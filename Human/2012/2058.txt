A Comprehensive Study and Performance Comparison of M-ary Modulation Schemes for an Efficient Wireless Mobile Communication System

Wireless communications has become one of the fastest growing areas in our modern life and creates enormous impact on nearly every feature of our daily life. In this paper, the performance of M-ary modulations schemes (MPSK, MQAM, MFSK) based wireless communication system on audio signal transmission over Additive Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel are analyzed in terms of bit error probability as a function of SNR. Based on the results obtained in the present study, MPSK and MQAM are showing better performance for lower modulation order whereas these are inferior with higher M. The BER value is smaller in MFSK for higher M, but it is worse due to the distortion in the reproduce signal at the receiver end. The lossless reproduction of recorded voice signal can be achieved at the receiver end with a lower modulation order.
