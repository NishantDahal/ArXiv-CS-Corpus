Exploiting Particle Swarm Optimization in Multiple Faults Fuzzy Detection

In this paper an on-line multiple faults detection approach is first of all proposed. For efficiency, an optimal design of membership functions is required. Thus, the proposed approach is improved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. The inputs of the proposed approaches are residuals representing the numerical evaluation of Analytical Redundancy Relations. These residuals are generated due to the use of bond graph modeling. The results of the fuzzy detection modules are displayed as a colored causal graph. A comparison between the results obtained by using PSO and those given by the use of Genetic Algorithms (GA) is finally made. The experiments focus on a simulation of the three-tank hydraulic system, a benchmark in the diagnosis domain.
