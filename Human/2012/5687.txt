Automatic Control Software Synthesis for Quantized Discrete Time Hybrid Systems

Many Embedded Systems are indeed Software Based Control Systems, that is control systems whose controller consists of control software running on a microcontroller device. This motivates investigation on Formal Model Based Design approaches for automatic synthesis of embedded systems control software. This paper addresses control software synthesis for discrete time nonlinear systems. We present a methodology to overapproximate the dynamics of a discrete time nonlinear hybrid system H by means of a discrete time linear hybrid system L(H), in such a way that controllers for L(H) are guaranteed to be controllers for H. We present experimental results on the inverted pendulum, a challenging and meaningful benchmark in nonlinear Hybrid Systems control.
