Experimental Analysis of AODV & DSR over TCP & CBR Connections with Varying Speed and Node Density in VANET

Vehicular adhoc network or VANET is special types of adhoc network consists of moving cars referred to as nodes; provide a way to exchange any information between cars without depending on fixed infrastructure. For efficient communication between nodes various routing protocols and mobility models have been proposed based on different scenarios. Due to rapid topology changing and frequent disconnection makes it difficult to select suitable mobility model and routing protocols. Hence performance evaluation and comparison between routing protocols is required to understand any routing protocol as well as to develop a new routing protocol. In this research paper, the performance of two on-demand routing protocols AODV & DSR has been analyzed by means of packet delivery ratio, loss packet ratio & average end-to-end delay with varying speed limit and node density under TCP & CBR connection.
