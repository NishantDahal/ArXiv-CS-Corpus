Some drastic improvements found in the analysis of routing protocol for the Bluetooth technology using scatternet

Bluetooth is a promising wireless technology that enables portable devices to form short-range wireless ad hoc networks. Unlike wireless LAN, the communication of Bluetooth devices follow a strict master slave relationship, that is, it is not possible for a slave device to directly communicate with another slave device even though they are within the radio coverage of each other. For inter piconet communication, a scatternet has to be formed, in which some Bluetooth devices have to act as bridge nodes between piconets. The Scatternet formed have following properties in which they are connected i.e every Bluetooth device can be reached from every other device, Piconet size is limited to eight nodes [1]. The author of this research paper have studied different type of routing protocol and have made efforts to improve throughput and reduce packet loss due to failure in the routing loop and increased mobility and improve the cohesive network structure, resolve the change topology conflicts [2], and a successful & efficient transfer of packet from source to destination.
