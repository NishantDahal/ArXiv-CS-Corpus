Cancellation-free circuits: An approach for proving superlinear lower bounds for linear Boolean operators

We continue to study the notion of cancellation-free linear circuits. We show that every matrix can be computed by a cancellation- free circuit, and almost all of these are at most a constant factor larger than the optimum linear circuit that computes the matrix. It appears to be easier to prove statements about the structure of cancellation-free linear circuits than for linear circuits in general. We prove two nontrivial superlinear lower bounds. We show that a cancellation-free linear circuit computing the $n\times n$ Sierpinski gasket matrix must use at least 1/2 n logn gates, and that this is tight. This supports a conjecture by Aaronson. Furthermore we show that a proof strategy for proving lower bounds on monotone circuits can be almost directly converted to prove lower bounds on cancellation-free linear circuits. We use this together with a result from extremal graph theory due to Andreev to prove a lower bound of Ω(n^(2- ε)) for infinitely many $n \times n$ matrices for every $ε> 0$ for. These lower bounds for concrete matrices are almost optimal since all matrices can be computed with $O(n^2/\log n)$ gates.
