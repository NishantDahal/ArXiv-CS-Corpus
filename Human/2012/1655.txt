Market-Oriented Cloud Computing and the Cloudbus Toolkit

Cloud computing has penetrated the Information Technology industry deep enough to influence major companies to adopt it into their mainstream business. A strong thrust on the use of virtualization technology to realize Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) has led enterprises to leverage subscription-oriented computing capabilities of public Clouds for hosting their application services. In parallel, research in academia has been investigating transversal aspects such as security, software frameworks, quality of service, and standardization. We believe that the complete realization of the Cloud computing vision will lead to the introduction of a virtual market where Cloud brokers, on behalf of end users, are in charge of selecting and composing the services advertised by different Cloud vendors. In order to make this happen, existing solutions and technologies have to be redesigned and extended from a market-oriented perspective and integrated together, giving rise to what we term Market-Oriented Cloud Computing.
  In this paper, we will assess the current status of Cloud computing by providing a reference model, discuss the challenges that researchers and IT practitioners are facing and will encounter in the near future, and present the approach for solving them from the perspective of the Cloudbus toolkit, which comprises of a set of technologies geared towards the realization of Market Oriented Cloud Computing vision. We provide experimental results demonstrating market-oriented resource provisioning and brokering within a Cloud and across multiple distributed resources. We also include an application illustrating the hosting of ECG analysis as SaaS on Amazon IaaS (EC2 and S3) services.
