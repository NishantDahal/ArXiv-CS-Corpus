Generalized Asynchronous Systems

The paper is devoted to a mathematical model of concurrency the special case of which is asynchronous system. Distributed asynchronous automata are introduced here. It is proved that the Petri nets and transition systems with independence can be considered like the distributed asynchronous automata. Time distributed asynchronous automata are defined in standard way by the map which assigns time intervals to events. It is proved that the time distributed asynchronous automata are generalized the time Petri nets and asynchronous systems.
