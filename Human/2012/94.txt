A Knowledge Engineering Method for New Product Development

Engineering activities involve large groups of people from different domains and disciplines. They often generate important information flows that are difficult to manage. To face these difficulties, a knowledge engineering process is necessary to structure the information and its use. This paper presents a deployment of a knowledge capitalization process based on the enrichment of MOKA methodology to support the integration of Process Planning knowledge in a CAD System. Our goal is to help different actors to work collaboratively by proposing one referential view of the domain, the context and the objectives assuming that it will help them in better decision-making.
