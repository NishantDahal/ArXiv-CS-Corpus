A Robust Client Verification in cloud enabled m-Commerce using Gaining Protocol

The proposed system highlights a novel approach of exclusive verification process using gain protocol for ensuring security among both the parties (client-service provider) in m-commerce application with cloud enabled service. The proposed system is based on the potential to verify the clients with trusted hand held device depending on the set of frequent events and actions to be carried out. The framework of the proposed work is design after collecting a real time data sets from an android enabled hand set, which when subjected to gain protocol, will result in detection of malicious behavior of illegal clients in the network. The real time experiment is performed with applicable datasets gather, which show the best result for identifying threats from last 2 months data collected.
