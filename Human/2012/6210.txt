Measurability Aspects of the Compactness Theorem for Sample Compression Schemes

It was proved in 1998 by Ben-David and Litman that a concept space has a sample compression scheme of size d if and only if every finite subspace has a sample compression scheme of size d. In the compactness theorem, measurability of the hypotheses of the created sample compression scheme is not guaranteed; at the same time measurability of the hypotheses is a necessary condition for learnability. In this thesis we discuss when a sample compression scheme, created from com- pression schemes on finite subspaces via the compactness theorem, have measurable hypotheses. We show that if X is a standard Borel space with a d-maximum and universally separable concept class C, then (X,C) has a sample compression scheme of size d with universally Borel measurable hypotheses. Additionally we introduce a new variant of compression scheme called a copy sample compression scheme.
