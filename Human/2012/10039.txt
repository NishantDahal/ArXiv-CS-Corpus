Introducing Variable Importance Tradeoffs into CP-Nets

The ability to make decisions and to assess potential courses of action is a corner-stone of many AI applications, and usually this requires explicit information about the decision-maker      s preferences. IN many applications,     preference elicitation IS a serious bottleneck.The USER either does      NOT have the time, the knowledge, OR     the expert support required TO specify complex multi - attribute utility      functions. IN such cases, a method that IS based ON intuitive,     yet expressive,     preference statements IS required. IN this paper we suggest the USE      OF TCP - nets, an enhancement OF CP - nets, AS a tool FOR     representing, AND     reasoning about qualitative preference statements.We present AND      motivate this framework, define its semantics, AND     show how it can be used TO perform constrained optimization.
