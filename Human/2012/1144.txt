Collaboration for enhancing the system development process in open source diligence

According to different opponents and commercial giants in software industries, the open source style software development has enough capacity to complete successfully the large scale projects. But we have seen many flaws and loops in collaboration and handling of mega scale projects in open source environment. Perhaps the collaboration is a key of successful project development. In this article we have tries to identify different feasible and reliable solution to a better collaboration ways in the open source system development. Some of the issues also that are found in the development phase of the open source have been identified and a proposed solution by explaining Successful communities such as GNU, the Apache Software Foundation, and Eclipse Foundation is discusses in this research article.
