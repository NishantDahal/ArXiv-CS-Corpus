Iterative decoding of Generalized Parallel Concatenated Block codes using cyclic permutations

Iterative decoding techniques have gain popularity due to their performance and their application in most communications systems. In this paper, we present a new application of our iterative decoder on the GPCB (Generalized Parallel Concatenated Block codes) which uses cyclic permutations. We introduce a new variant of the component decoder. After extensive simulation; the obtained result is very promising compared with several existing methods. We evaluate the effects of various parameters component codes, interleaver size, block size, and the number of iterations. Three interesting results are obtained; the first one is that the performances in terms of BER (Bit Error Rate) of the new constituent decoder are relatively similar to that of original one. Secondly our turbo decoding outperforms another turbo decoder for some linear block codes. Thirdly the proposed iterative decoding of GPCB-BCH (75, 51) is about 2.1dB from its Shannon limit.
