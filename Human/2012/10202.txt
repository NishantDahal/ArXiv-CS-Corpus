A Comparison between CODYRUN and TRNSYS, simulation models for thermal buildings behaviour

Simulation codes of thermal behaviour could significantly improve housing construction design. Among the existing software, CODYRUN and TRNSYS are calculations codes of different conceptions. CODYRUN is exclusively dedicated to housing thermal behaviour, whereas TRNSYS is more generally used on any thermal system. The purpose of this article is to compare these two instruments in two different conditions . We will first modelize a mono-zone test cell, and analyse the results by means of signal treatment methods. Then, we will modelize a real case of multi-zone housing, representative of housing in wet tropical climates. We could so evaluate influences of meteorological and building description data on model errors.
