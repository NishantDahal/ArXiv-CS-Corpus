A Simultaneous-Movement Mobile Multiplayer Game Design based on Adaptive Background Partitioning Technique

Implementations of mobile games have become prevalent industrial technology due to the ubiquitous nature of mobile devices. However, simultaneous-movement multiplayer games, games that a player competes simultaneously with other players, are usually affected by such parameters as latency, type of game architecture and type of communication technology. This paper makes a review of the above parameters, considering the pros and cons of the various techniques used in addressing each parameter. It then goes ahead to propose an enhanced mechanism for dealing with packet delays based on partitioning the game background into grids. The proposed design is implemented and tested using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi communication technologies. The efficiency and effectiveness of the design are also analyzed.
