Sociotechnical Management Model for Governance of an Ecosystem

This is an opinion paper regarding a proposal of a model for a Ecosystemm Governance. In the globalized world the importance of Information Systems (IS) and Information Technology (IT) become increasingly relevant regarding the requirements imposed by competition. Both the knowledge of the business as the rapid flow of information are fundamental for a enterprise decision making. Whereas the basic definition of IT = hardware + software, i.e., tools that has been used to create, store and disseminate data and information in the creation of knowledge, and IS = IT + People + procedures that collect, process and disseminate the information to support decision making, coordination, control, analysis and visualization in the organization [01], it makes implicit the understanding of IS is essential to create competitive companies, to manage global corporations and provide customers with products and services of value. In this work we are correlating IS with the governance of management of an ecosystem. Yet, as IT is redefining the foundations of business, then the customer service, operations, strategies of product marketing and its distribution and even the knowledge management (KM) depends very much, or sometimes even completely, on the IS. The IT and its costs have become a part of day-to-day business [02]. In order to meet this complexity of business needs, today is not possible to disregard the IT and its available resources, which makes very dificult to draw up IS. Therefore, the perspective view of the Sociotehcnical Aspects of an IS are directly concerned with governance and the model proposed regarding an ecosystem. Finally, whereas the summary above, the main objective of this opinion paper is to propose the guidelines for a Sociotechnical Management Model of Governance for an Ecosystem.
