Irregular Bipolar Fuzzy Graphs

In this paper, we define irregular bipolar fuzzy graphs and its various classifications. Size of regular bipolar fuzzy graphs is derived. The relation between highly and neighbourly irregular bipolar fuzzy graphs are established. Some basic theorems related to the stated graphs have also been presented.
