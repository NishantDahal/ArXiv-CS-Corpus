Hardness of conjugacy and factorization of multidimensional subshifts of finite type

We investigate here the hardness of conjugacy and factorization of subshifts of finite type (SFTs) in dimension $d>1$. In particular, we prove that the factorization problem is $Σ^0_3$-complete and the conjugacy problem $Σ^0_1$-complete in the arithmetical hierarchy.
