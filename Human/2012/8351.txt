Developing ICC Profile Using Gray Level Control In Offset Printing Process

In prepress department RGB image has to be converted to CMYK image. To control that amount of black, cyan, magenta and yellow has to be controlled by using color separation method. Graycolor separation method is selected to control the amounts of these colors because it increase the quality of printing also. A single printer used for printing the same image on different paper also results in different printed images. To remove this problem a different ICC profile based on gray level control is developedand a sheet offset printer is calibrated using that profile and a subjective evaluation shows satisfactory results for different quality papers.
