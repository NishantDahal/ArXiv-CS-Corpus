Achievable Rate Regions for the Dirty Multiple Access Channel with Partial Side Information at the Transmitters

In this paper, we establish achievable rate regions for the multiple access channel (MAC) with side information partially known (estimated or sensed version) at the transmitters. Actually, we extend the lattice strategies used by Philosof-Zamir for the MAC with full side information at the transmitters to the partially known case. We show that the sensed or estimated side information reduces the rate regions, the same as that occurs for Costa Gaussian channel.
