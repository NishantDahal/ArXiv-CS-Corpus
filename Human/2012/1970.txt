Analysis of Sparse MIMO Radar

We consider a multiple-input-multiple-output radar system and derive a theoretical framework for the recoverability of targets in the azimuth-range domain and the azimuth-range-Doppler domain via sparse approximation algorithms. Using tools developed in the area of compressive sensing, we prove bounds on the number of detectable targets and the achievable resolution in the presence of additive noise. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical simulations.
