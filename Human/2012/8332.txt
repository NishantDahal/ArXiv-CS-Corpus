Mod√©lisation multi-niveaux dans AA4MM

In this article, we propose to represent a multi-level phenomenon as a set of interacting models. This perspective makes the levels of representation and their relationships explicit. To deal with coherence, causality and coordination issues between models, we rely on AA4MM, a metamodel dedicated to such a representation. We illustrate our proposal and we show the interest of our approach on a flocking phenomenon.
