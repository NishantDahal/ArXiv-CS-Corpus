Systematic Construction of Temporal Logics for Dynamical Systems via Coalgebra

Temporal logics are an obvious high-level descriptive companion formalism to dynamical systems which model behavior as deterministic evolution of state over time. A wide variety of distinct temporal logics applicable to dynamical systems exists, and each candidate has its own pragmatic justification. Here, a systematic approach to the construction of temporal logics for dynamical systems is proposed: Firstly, it is noted that dynamical systems can be seen as coalgebras in various ways. Secondly, a straightforward standard construction of modal logics out of coalgebras, namely Moss's coalgebraic logic, is applied. Lastly, the resulting systems are characterized with respect to the temporal properties they express.
