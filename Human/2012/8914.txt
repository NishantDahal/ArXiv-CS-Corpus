A Coherent Distributed Grid Service for Assimilation and Unification of Heterogeneous Data Source

Grid services are heavily used for handling large distributed computations. They are also very useful to handle heavy data intensive applications where data are distributed in different sites. Most of the data grid services used in such situations are meant for homogeneous data source. In case of Heterogeneous data sources, most of the grid services that are available are designed such a way that they must be identical in schema definition for their smooth operation. But there can be situations where the grid site databases are heterogeneous and their schema definition is different from the central schema definition. In this paper we propose a light weight coherent grid service for heterogeneous data sources that is very easily install. It can map and convert the central SQL schema into that of the grid members and send queries to get according results from heterogeneous data sources.
