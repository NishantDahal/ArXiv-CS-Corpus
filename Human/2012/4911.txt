CyberChair: A Web-Based Groupware Application to Facilitate the Paper Reviewing Process

In this paper we describe CyberChair, a web-based groupware application that supports the review process for technical contributions to conferences. CyberChair deals with most administrative tasks that are involved in the review process, such as storing author information, abstracts, (camera-ready) papers and reviews. It generates several overviews based on the reviews which support the Program Committee (PC) in selecting the best papers. CyberChair points out conflicting reviews and offers the reviewers means to easily communicate to solve these conflicts. In his paper Identify the Champion, O. Nierstrasz describes this review process in terms of a pattern language. CyberChair supports PCs by using these patterns in its implementation.
