Lessons Learned/Sharing the Experience of Developing a Metro System Case Study

In this document we share the experiences gained throughout the development of a metro system case study. The model is constructed in Event-B using its respective tool set, the Rodin platform. Starting from requirements, adding more details to the model in a stepwise manner through refinement, we identify some keys points and available plugins necessary for modelling large systems (requirement engineering, decomposition, generic instantiation, among others), which ones are lacking plus strengths and weaknesses of the tool.
