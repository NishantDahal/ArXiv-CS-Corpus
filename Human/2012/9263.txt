Modeling the resilience of large and evolving systems

This paper summarizes the state of knowledge and ongoing research on methods and techniques for resilience evaluation, taking into account the resilience-scaling challenges and properties related to the ubiquitous computerized systems. We mainly focus on quantitative evaluation approaches and, in particular, on model-based evaluation techniques that are commonly used to evaluate and compare, from the dependability point of view, different architecture alternatives at the design stage. We outline some of the main modeling techniques aiming at mastering the largeness of analytical dependability models at the construction level. Actually, addressing the model largeness problem is important with respect to the investigation of the scalability of current techniques to meet the complexity challenges of ubiquitous systems. Finally we present two case studies in which some of the presented techniques are applied for modeling web services and General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) mobile telephone networks, as prominent examples of large and evolving systems.
