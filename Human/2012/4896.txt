A Survey on Various Data Hiding Techniques and their Comparative Analysis

With the explosive growth of internet and the fast communication techniques in recent years the security and the confidentiality of the sensitive data has become of prime and supreme importance and concern. To protect this data from unauthorized access and tampering various methods for data hiding like cryptography, hashing, authentication have been developed and are in practice today. In this paper we will be discussing one such data hiding technique called Steganography. Steganography is the process of concealing sensitive information in any media to transfer it securely over the underlying unreliable and unsecured communication network. Our paper presents a survey on various data hiding techniques in Steganography that are in practice today along with the comparative analysis of these techniques.
