On the Convergence of Collaboration and Knowledge Management

Collaboration technology typically focuses on collaboration and group processes (cooperation, communication, coordination and coproduction). Knowledge Management (KM) technology typically focuses on content (creation, storage, sharing and use of data, information and knowledge). Yet, to achieve their common goals, teams and organizations need both KM and collaboration technology to make that more effective and efficient. This paper is interested in knowledge management and collaboration regarding their convergence and their integration. First, it contributes to a better understanding of the knowledge management and collaboration concepts. Second, it focuses on KM and collaboration convergence by presenting the different interpretation of this convergence. Third, this paper proposes a generic framework of collaborative knowledge management.
