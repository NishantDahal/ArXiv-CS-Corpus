Adaptive and Dynamic Wireless Routers with Smart Antenna for Power Management

In the recent evolution of wireless technologies, the power management has been a worrying factor. In order to overcome the power shortage, steps are taken to find new kind of energy harvesting methods, power attenuation reduction methods and power saving techniques. Wireless routers even though consume not much of power, battery powered devices require a lot. Omni directional antenna embedded with multiple antennae focusing the beam of radio wave signals in the direction of nodes with least transmission angle can be a solution for this problem which is called as "Smart Antenna". To reduce power maceration we are going for adaptive and dynamic transmission wherein the transmission angle of antennae is varied in accordance with the movement of nodes. Apart from saving the power considerably, it also improves the signal strength
