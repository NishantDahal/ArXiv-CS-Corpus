On applying Neuro - Computing in E-com Domain

Prior studies have generally suggested that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are superior to conventional statistical models in predicting consumer buying behavior. There are, however, contradicting findings which raise question over usefulness of ANNs. This paper discusses development of three neural networks for modeling consumer e-commerce behavior and compares the findings to equivalent logistic regression models. The results showed that ANNs predict e-commerce adoption slightly more accurately than logistic models but this is hardly justifiable given the added complexity. Further, ANNs seem to be highly adaptive, particularly when a small sample is coupled with a large number of nodes in hidden layers which, in turn, limits the neural networks' generalisability.
