Clustering of tag-induced sub-graphs in complex networks

We study the behavior of the clustering coefficient in tagged networks. The rich variety of tags associated with the nodes in the studied systems provide additional information about the entities represented by the nodes which can be important for practical applications like searching in the networks. Here we examine how the clustering coefficient changes when narrowing the network to a sub-graph marked by a given tag, and how does it correlate with various other properties of the sub-graph. Another interesting question addressed in the paper is how the clustering coefficient of the individual nodes is affected by the tags on the node. We believe these sort of analysis help acquiring a more complete description of the structure of large complex systems.
