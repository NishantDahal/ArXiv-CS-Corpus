A New Greedy Algorithm for Multiple Sparse Regression

This paper proposes a new algorithm for multiple sparse regression in high dimensions, where the task is to estimate the support and values of several (typically related) sparse vectors from a few noisy linear measurements. Our algorithm is a "forward-backward" greedy procedure that -- uniquely -- operates on two distinct classes of objects. In particular, we organize our target sparse vectors as a matrix; our algorithm involves iterative addition and removal of both (a) individual elements, and (b) entire rows (corresponding to shared features), of the matrix.
  Analytically, we establish that our algorithm manages to recover the supports (exactly) and values (approximately) of the sparse vectors, under assumptions similar to existing approaches based on convex optimization. However, our algorithm has a much smaller computational complexity. Perhaps most interestingly, it is seen empirically to require visibly fewer samples. Ours represents the first attempt to extend greedy algorithms to the class of models that can only/best be represented by a combination of component structural assumptions (sparse and group-sparse, in our case).
