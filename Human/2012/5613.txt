Content Based Multimedia Information Retrieval to Support Digital Libraries

Content-based multimedia information retrieval is an interesting research area since it allows retrieval based on inherent characteristic of multimedia objects. For example retrieval based on visual characteristics such as colour, shapes or textures of objects in images or retrieval based on spatial relationships among objects in the media (images or video clips). This paper reviews some work done in image and video retrieval and then proposes an integrated model that can handle images and video clips uniformly. Using this model retrieval on images or video clips can be done based on the same framework.
