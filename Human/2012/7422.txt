Goldbach Circles and Balloons and Their Cross Correlation

Goldbach partitions can be used in creation of ellipses and circles on the number line. We extend this work and determine the count and other properties of concentric Goldbach circles for different values of n. The autocorrelation function of this sequence with respect to even and odd values suggests that it has excellent randomness properties. Cross correlation properties of ellipse and circle sequences are provided that indicate that these sequences have minimal dependencies and, therefore, they can be used in spread spectrum and other cryptographic applications.
