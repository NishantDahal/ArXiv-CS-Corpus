Berlekamp's Switching Game on Finite Projective and Affine Planes

I adapt Berlekamp's light bulb switching game to finite projective plans and finite affine planes, then find the worst arrangement of lit bulbs for planes of even and odd orders. The results are then extended from the planes to spaces of higher dimension.
