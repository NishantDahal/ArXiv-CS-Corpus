Customised high-value document generation

Contributions of different experts to innovation projects improve enterprise value, captured in documents. A subset of them is the centre of expert constraint convergence. Their production needs to be tailored case by case. Documents are often considered as knowledge transcription. As the base of a structured knowledge-based information environment, this paper presents a global approach that helps knowledge-integration tool deployment. An example, based on process plan in aircraft manufacturing, indicates how fundamental understanding of domain infrastructure contributes to a more coherent architecture of knowledge-based information environments. A comparison with an experiment in insurance services generalised the application of presented principles.
