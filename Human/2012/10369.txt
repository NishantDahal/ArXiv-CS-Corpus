Proceedings Quantities in Formal Methods

This volume contains the proceedings of the Workshop on Quantities in Formal Methods, QFM 2012, held in Paris, France on 28 August 2012. The workshop was affiliated with the 18th Symposium on Formal Methods, FM 2012. The focus of the workshop was on quantities in modeling, verification, and synthesis. Modern applications of formal methods require to reason formally on quantities such as time, resources, or probabilities. Standard formal methods and tools have gotten very good at modeling (and verifying) qualitative properties: whether or not certain events will occur. During the last years, these methods and tools have been extended to also cover quantitative aspects, notably leading to tools like e.g. UPPAAL (for real-time systems), PRISM (for probabilistic systems), and PHAVer (for hybrid systems). A lot of work remains to be done however before these tools can be used in the industrial applications at which they are aiming.
