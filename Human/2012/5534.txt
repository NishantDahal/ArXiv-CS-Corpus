A Methodology to manage victim components using CBO measure

The current practices of software industry demands development of a software within time and budget which is highly productive. The traditional approach of developing a software from scratch requires considerable amount of effort. To overcome the drawback a reuse drive software development approach is adopted. However there is a dire need for realizing effective software reuse. This paper presents several measures of reusability and presents a methodology of reconfiguring the victim components. The CBO measure helps in identifying the component to be reconfigured. The proposed strategy is simulated using HR portal domain specific component system.
