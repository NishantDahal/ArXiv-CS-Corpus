On the Non-robustness of Essentially Conditional Information Inequalities

We show that two essentially conditional linear inequalities for Shannon's entropies (including the Zhang-Yeung'97 conditional inequality) do not hold for asymptotically entropic points. This means that these inequalities are non-robust in a very strong sense. This result raises the question of the meaning of these inequalities and the validity of their use in practice-oriented applications.
