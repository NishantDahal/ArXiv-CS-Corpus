Estimacao Temporal da Deformacao entre Objectos utilizando uma Metodologia Fisica

In this paper, it is presented a methodology to estimate the deformation involved between two objects attending to its physical properties. This methodology can be used, for example, in Computational Vision or Computer Graphics applications, and consists in physically modeling the objects, by means of the Finite Elements Method, establishing correspondences between some of its data points, by using Modal Matching, and finally, determining the displacement field, that is the intermediate shapes, through the resolution of the Lagrange Dynamic Equilibrium Equation. As in many of the possible applications of the methodology to present, it is necessary to quantify the existing deformation, as well as to estimate only the non rigid component of the involved global deformation. The solutions adopted to satisfy such intentions will be also presented.
