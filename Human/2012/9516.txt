Using ontology for resume annotation

Employers collect a large number of resumes from job portals, or from the company's own website. These documents are used for an automated selection of candidates satisfying the requirements and therefore reducing recruitment costs. Various approaches for process documents have already been developed for recruitment. In this paper we present an approach based on semantic annotation of resumes for e-recruitment process. The most important task consists on modelling the semantic content of these documents using ontology. The ontology is built taking into account the most significant components of resumes inspired from the structure of EUROPASS CV. This ontology is thereafter used to annotate automatically the resumes.
