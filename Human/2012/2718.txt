Improving Customer Service in Healthcare with CRM 2.0

The Healthcare industry is undergoing a paradigm shift from healthcare institution-centred care to a citizen-centred care that emphasises on continuity of care from prevention to rehabilitation. The recent development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), especially the Internet and its related technologies has become the main driver of the paradigm shift. Managing relationship with customers (patients) is becoming more important in the new paradigm. The paper discusses Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in healthcare and proposes a Social CRM or CRM 2.0 model to take advantage of the multi-way relationships created by Web 2.0 and its widespread use in improving customer services for mutual benefits between healthcare providers and their customers.
