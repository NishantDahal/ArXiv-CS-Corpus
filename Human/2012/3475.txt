Language-Constraint Reachability Learning in Probabilistic Graphs

The probabilistic graphs framework models the uncertainty inherent in real-world domains by means of probabilistic edges whose value quantifies the likelihood of the edge existence or the strength of the link it represents. The goal of this paper is to provide a learning method to compute the most likely relationship between two nodes in a framework based on probabilistic graphs. In particular, given a probabilistic graph we adopted the language-constraint reachability method to compute the probability of possible interconnections that may exists between two nodes. Each of these connections may be viewed as feature, or a factor, between the two nodes and the corresponding probability as its weight. Each observed link is considered as a positive instance for its corresponding link label. Given the training set of observed links a L2-regularized Logistic Regression has been adopted to learn a model able to predict unobserved link labels. The experiments on a real world collaborative filtering problem proved that the proposed approach achieves better results than that obtained adopting classical methods.
