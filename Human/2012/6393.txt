Evaluation of Computational Grammar Formalisms for Indian Languages

Natural Language Parsing has been the most prominent research area since the genesis of Natural Language Processing. Probabilistic Parsers are being developed to make the process of parser development much easier, accurate and fast. In Indian context, identification of which Computational Grammar Formalism is to be used is still a question which needs to be answered. In this paper we focus on this problem and try to analyze different formalisms for Indian languages.
