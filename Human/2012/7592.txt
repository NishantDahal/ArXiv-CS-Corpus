Simulating Performance of a BitTorrent-Based P2P TV System

In this paper we describe a prototype of a simulation framework and some ideas which are to be used to study performance of a P2P TV system in a controllable and adjustable environment. We created a simplified model describing live video distribution in a P2P TV system. Using the model we analyse how some of the system parameters influence its behaviour. We present the preliminary results obtained at different granularity levels of measurements, describing the macroscopic system performance as well as the performance of its individual components.
