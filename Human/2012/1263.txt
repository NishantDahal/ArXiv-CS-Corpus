Defeating the Kalka--Teicher--Tsaban linear algebra attack on the Algebraic Eraser

The Algebraic Eraser (AE) is a public key protocol for sharing information over an insecure channel using commutative and noncommutative groups; a concrete realization is given by Colored Burau Key Agreement Protocol (CBKAP). In this paper, we describe how to choose data in CBKAP to thwart an attack by Kalka--Teicher--Tsaban.
