Does Parrondo Paradox occur in Scale Free Networks? -A simple Consideration-

Parrondo's paradox occurs in sequences of games in which a winning expectation may be obtained by playing the games in a random order, even though each game in the sequence may be lost when played individually. Several variations of Parrondo's games apparently with paradoxical property have been introduced; history dependence, one dimensional line, two dimensional lattice and so on. In this article, we examine whether Parrondo's paradox occurs or not in scale free networks. This is interesting as an empirical study, since scale free networks are ubiquitous in our real world. First some simulation results are given and after that theoretical studies are made. As a result, we mostly confirm that Parrondo's paradox can not occur in the naive case, where the game has the same number of parameters as the original Parrondo's game.
