An Optimal Fully Distributed Algorithm to Minimize the Resource Consumption of Cloud Applications

According to the pay-per-use model adopted in clouds, the more the resources consumed by an application running in a cloud computing environment, the greater the amount of money the owner of the corresponding application will be charged. Therefore, applying intelligent solutions to minimize the resource consumption is of great importance. Because centralized solutions are deemed unsuitable for large-distributed systems or large-scale applications, we propose a fully distributed algorithm (called DRA) to overcome the scalability issues. Specifically, DRA migrates the inter-communicating components of an application, such as processes or virtual machines, close to each other to minimize the total resource consumption. The migration decisions are made in a dynamic way and based only on local information. We prove that DRA achieves convergence and results always in the optimal solution.
