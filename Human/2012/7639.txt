Quadratic time $O(n^2)$ Fully Homomorphic public key encryption algorithm based on a unique technique to create p-adic homomorphism from ring X to ring Y

ZK111 is a fully homomorphic public key encryption algorithm which runs in quadratic time. It's security solely relies upon a very unique 'color-blind' function which is used to create p-adic ring homomorphism.
