Tolerant identification with Euclidean balls

The concept of identifying codes was introduced by Karpovsky, Chakrabarty and Levitin in 1998. The identifying codes can be applied, for example, to sensor networks. In this paper, we consider as sensors the set Z^2 where one sensor can check its neighbours within Euclidean distance r. We construct tolerant identifying codes in this network that are robust against some changes in the neighbourhood monitored by each sensor. We give bounds for the smallest density of a tolerant identifying code for general values of r and Delta. We also provide infinite families of values (r,Delta) with optimal such codes and study the case of small values of r.
