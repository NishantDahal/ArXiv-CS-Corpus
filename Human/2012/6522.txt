A Novel Architecture for Antenna Arrangement in Wireless Cellular CDMA Systems

Wise arrangement of antennas is critical in wireless cellular systems for both reduction of co-channel interference (CCI) and increase the quality of service (QoS). In this paper, a novel architecture for antenna arrangement in CDMA wireless cellular systems is presented. In this architecture that we called microzone, every cell is divided into three (or more) zones and information transmission in downlink channel is done by an antenna which is placed at the outer region of the related zone. Also, the transmitting signal by the mobile station (MS) in uplink channel is received by all antennas of the related cell. Analytical calculations of the received signal to noise ratio (SIR) and outage probability for both microzone and used architectures show that proposed architecture has better performance in compared with the used architecture. Also, simulation results confirm lower outage probability in uplink channel for microzone architecture.
