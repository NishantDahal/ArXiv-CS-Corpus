Semantic Polarity of Adjectival Predicates in Online Reviews

Web users produce more and more documents expressing opinions. Because these have become important resources for customers and manufacturers, many have focused on them. Opinions are often expressed through adjectives with positive or negative semantic values. In extracting information from users' opinion in online reviews, exact recognition of the semantic polarity of adjectives is one of the most important requirements. Since adjectives have different semantic orientations according to contexts, it is not satisfying to extract opinion information without considering the semantic and lexical relations between the adjectives and the feature nouns appropriate to a given domain. In this paper, we present a classification of adjectives by polarity, and we analyze adjectives that are undetermined in the absence of contexts. Our research should be useful for accurately predicting semantic orientations of opinion sentences, and should be taken into account before relying on an automatic methods.
