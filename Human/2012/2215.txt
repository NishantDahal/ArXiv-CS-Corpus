Joint Estimation of Angle and Delay of Radio Wave Arrival under Multiplicative Noise Environment

We propose a novel technique for joint estimation of angle and delay of radio wave arrival in a multipath mobile communication channel using knowledge of the transmitted pulse shape function. Employing an array of sensors to sample the radio received signal, and subsequent array signal processing can provide the characterization of a high-rank channel in terms of the multipath angles of arrival and time delays. Although several works have been reported in the literature for estimation of the high-rank channel parameters, we are not aware of any work that deals with the problem of estimation in a fading channel, which essentially leads to a multiplicative noise environment.
