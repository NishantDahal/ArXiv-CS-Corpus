Discovering Links for Metadata Enrichment on Computer Science Papers

At the very beginning of compiling a bibliography, usually only basic information, such as title, authors and publication date of an item are known. In order to gather additional information about a specific item, one typically has to search the library catalog or use a web search engine. This look-up procedure implies a manual effort for every single item of a bibliography. In this technical report we present a proof of concept which utilizes Linked Data technology for the simple enrichment of sparse metadata sets. This is done by discovering owl:sameAs links be- tween an initial set of computer science papers and resources from external data sources like DBLP, ACM and the Semantic Web Conference Corpus. In this report, we demonstrate how the link discovery tool Silk is used to detect additional information and to enrich an initial set of records in the computer science domain. The pros and cons of silk as link discovery tool are summarized in the end.
