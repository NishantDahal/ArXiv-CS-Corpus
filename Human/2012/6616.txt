Calculations of Frequency Response Functions (FRF) Using Computer Smart Office Software and Nyquist Plot under Gyroscopic Effect Rotation

Regenerated (FRF curves), synthesis of (FRF) curves there are two main requirement in the form of response model, The first being that of regenerating "Theoretical" curve for the frequency response function actually measured and analysis and the second being that of synthesising the other functions which were not measured,(FRF) that isolates the inherent dynamic properties of a mechanical structure. Experimental modal parameters (frequency, damping, and mode shape) are also obtained from a set of (FRF) measurements. The (FRF) describes the input-output relationship between two points on a structure as a function of frequency. Therefore, an (FRF) is actually defined between a single input DOF (point & direction), and a single output (DOF), although the FRF was previously defined as a ratio of the Fourier transforms of an output and input signal. In this paper we detection FRF curve using Nyquist plot under gyroscopic effect in revolving structure using computer smart office software.
