A Universal Semi-totalistic Cellular Automaton on Kite and Dart Penrose Tilings

In this paper we investigate certain properties of semi-totalistic cellular automata (CA) on the well known quasi-periodic kite and dart two dimensional tiling of the plane presented by Roger Penrose. We show that, despite the irregularity of the underlying grid, it is possible to devise a semi-totalistic CA capable of simulating any boolean circuit on this aperiodic tiling.
