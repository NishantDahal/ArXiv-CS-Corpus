An Internet Approach for Engineering Student Exercises

An approach for engineering student exercises using the Internet is described. In this approach, for a given exercise, each student receives the same problem, but with different data. The exercise content can be static or dynamic, and the dynamic form can be timeless or real-time. The implementation provides immediate feedback to the students, letting them know if their submitted answers are correct. Student results for each exercise are recorded in log files which are available to the instructor. Example exercises from engineering computer security and cryptography courses are presented.
