Inverse Modeling of Climate Responses of Monumental Buildings

The indoor climate conditions of monumental buildings are very important for the conservation of these objects. Simplified models with physical meaning are desired that are capable of simulating temperature and relative humidity. In this paper we research state-space models as methodology for the inverse modeling of climate responses of unheated monumental buildings. It is concluded that this approach is very promising for obtaining physical models and parameters of indoor climate responses. Furthermore state space models can be simulated very efficiently: the simulation duration time of a 100 year hourly based period take less than a second on an ordinary computer.
