A scheme to protect against multiple quantum erasures

We present a scheme able to protect k >= 3 qubits of information against the occurrence of multiple erasures, based on the code proposed by Yang et al. (2004 JETP Letters 79 236). In this scheme redundant blocks are used and we restrict to the case that each erasure must occur in distinct blocks. We explicitly characterize the encoding operation and the restoring operation required to implement this scheme. The operators used in these operations can be adjusted to construct different quantum erasure-correcting codes. A special feature of this scheme is that no measurement is required. To illustrate our scheme, we present an example in which five-qubits of information are protected against the occurrence of two erasures.
