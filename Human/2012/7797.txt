Social Cheesecake: An UX-driven designed interface for managing contacts

Social network management interfaces should consider separation of contexts and tie strength. This paper shows the design process upon building the Social Cheesecake, an interface that addresses both issues. Paper and screen prototyping were used in the design process. Paper prototype interactions helped to explore the metaphors in the domain, while screen prototype consolidated the model. The prototype was finally built using HTML5 and Javascript.
