Spectrum Sensing in the Presence of Multiple Primary Users

We consider multi-antenna cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks, when there may be multiple primary users. A detector based on the spherical test is analyzed in such a scenario. Based on the moments of the distributions involved, simple and accurate analytical formulae for the key performance metrics of the detector are derived. The false alarm and the detection probabilities, as well as the detection threshold and Receiver Operation Characteristics are available in closed form. Simulations are provided to verify the accuracy of the derived results, and to compare with other detectors in realistic sensing scenarios.
