A model-driven approach for processing complex events

By adequate employing of complex event processing (CEP), valuable information can be extracted from the underlying complex system and used in controlling and decision situations. An example application area is management of IT systems for maintaining required dependability attributes of services based on the infrastructure. In practice, one usually faces the problem of the vast number of distributed event sources, which makes depicting complex event patterns a non-trivial task. In this paper, I present a novel, model-driven approach to define complex event patterns and directly generate event processing configuration for an open source CEP engine widely used in the industry. One of the key results of my research work is a textual modeling language called Complex Event Description Language (CEDL), which will be presented by its algebraic semantics and some typical examples.
