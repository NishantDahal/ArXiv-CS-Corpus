Securing a mobile adhoc network from routing attacks through the application of genetic algorithm

In recent years, the static shortest path (SP) problem has been well addressed using intelligent optimization techniques, e.g., artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms (GAs), particle swarm optimization, etc. However, with the advancement in wireless communications, more and more mobile wireless networks appear, e.g., mobile networks [mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs)], wireless sensor networks, etc. One of the most important characteristics in mobile wireless networks is the topology dynamics, i.e., the network topology changes over time due to energy conservation or node mobility. Therefore, the SP routing problem in MANETs turns out to be a dynamic optimization problem. GA's are able to find, if not the shortest, at least an optimal path between source and destination in mobile ad-hoc network nodes. And we obtain the alternative path or backup path to avoid reroute discovery in the case of link failure or node failure.
