Decision Principles to justify Carnap's Updating Method and to Suggest Corrections of Probability Judgments (Invited Talks)

This paper uses decision-theoretic principles to obtain new insights into the assessment and updating of probabilities. First, a new foundation of Bayesianism is given. It does not require infinite atomless uncertainties as did Savage      s classical result, AND     can therefore be applied TO ANY finite Bayesian network.It neither      requires linear utility AS did de Finetti      s classical result, AND r ntherefore allows FOR     the empirically AND     normatively desirable risk r naversion.Finally, BY     identifying AND fixing utility IN an elementary r nmanner,     our result can readily be applied TO identify methods OF r nprobability      updating.Thus,     a decision - theoretic foundation IS given r nto the computationally      efficient method OF inductive reasoning r ndeveloped BY     Rudolf Carnap.Finally, recent empirical findings ON     r nprobability assessments are discussed.It leads TO suggestions      FOR r ncorrecting biases IN probability assessments, AND FOR      an alternative r nto the Dempster - Shafer belief functions that avoids      the reduction TO r ndegeneracy after multiple updatings.r n
