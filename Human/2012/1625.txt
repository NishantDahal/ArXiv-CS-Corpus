Achieving Consensus with Individual Centrality Approach

This paper proposes a new consensus model in participatory decision making. The model employs advice centrality approach by electing a leader and recommender named as Supra Decision Maker (SDM). A SDM has a role as a decision bench-marker to other decision makers in evaluating each alternative with respect to given criteria. The weighting value for each alternative can be obtained by considering consensus level and preferences' distances between SDM and other Decision Makers. A social function using Social Judgment Scheme (SJS) concept is employed when a decision does not achieve the required consensus level. A simple example is presented here to illustrate our model.
