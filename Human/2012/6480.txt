Decreasing defect rate of test cases by designing and analysis for recursive modules of a program structure: Improvement in test cases

Designing and analysis of test cases is a challenging tasks for tester roles especially those who are related to test the structure of program. Recently, Programmers are showing valuable trend towards the implementation of recursive modules in a program structure. In testing phase of software development life cycle, test cases help the tester to test the structure and flow of program. The implementation of well designed test cases for a program leads to reduce the defect rate and efforts needed for corrective maintenance. In this paper, author proposed a strategy to design and analyze the test cases for a program structure of recursive modules. This strategy will definitely leads to validation of program structure besides reducing the defect rate and corrective maintenance efforts.
