A new path algorithm for the weighted multi-graphs WMGPA: application to the Direct Topological Method

The aim of this paper is to present an algorithm which gives all the possible paths that start from a specific node to another of a weighted multi-graph. This algorithm is intended to be applied for the direct topological method.
