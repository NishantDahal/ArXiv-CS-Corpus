Iterative Approximate Byzantine Consensus in Arbitrary Directed Graphs

In this paper, we explore the problem of iterative approximate Byzantine consensus in arbitrary directed graphs. In particular, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of iterative byzantine consensus algorithms. Additionally, we use our sufficient condition to examine whether such algorithms exist for some specific graphs.
