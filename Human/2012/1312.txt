Spatial MAC in MIMO Communications and its Application to Underlay Cognitive Radio

We propose a learning technique for MIMO secondary users (SU) to spatially coexist with Primary Users (PU). By learning the null space of the interference channel to the PU, the SU can utilize idle degrees of freedom that otherwise would be unused by the PU. This learning process does not require any handshake or explicit information exchange between the PU and the SU. The only requirement is that the PU broadcasts a periodic beacon that is a function of its noise plus interference power, through a low rate control channel. The learning process is based on energy measurements, independent of the transmission schemes of both the PU and SU, i.e. independent of their modulation, coding etc.. The proposed learning technique also provides a novel spatial division multiple access mechanism for equal-priority MIMO users sharing a common channel that highly increases the spectrum utilization compared to time based or frequency multiple access.
