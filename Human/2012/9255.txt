A bird's-eye view of scientific trading: Dependency relations among fields of science

We use a trading metaphor to study knowledge transfer in the sciences as well as the social sciences. The metaphor comprises four dimensions: (a) Discipline Self-dependence, (b) Knowledge Exports/Imports, (c) Scientific Trading Dynamics, and (d) Scientific Trading Impact. This framework is applied to a dataset of 221 Web of Science subject categories. We find that: (i) the Scientific Trading Impact and Dynamics of Materials Science And Transportation Science have increased; (ii) Biomedical Disciplines, Physics, And Mathematics are significant knowledge exporters, as is Statistics & Probability; (iii) in the social sciences, Economics, Business, Psychology, Management, And Sociology are important knowledge exporters; (iv) Discipline Self-dependence is associated with specialized domains which have ties to professional practice (e.g., Law, Ophthalmology, Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine, Psychology, Psychoanalysis, Veterinary Sciences, And Nursing).
