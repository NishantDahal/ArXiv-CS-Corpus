Improving Security Levels of IEEE 802.16e Authentication By Diffie-Hellman Method

In this paper, we proposed an authentication method according to Diffie-Hellman. First, we introduce different methods for authentication in IEEE.802.16 then we proposed an authentication method according to Diffie-Hellman and in the last we compare different methods for authentication to improve security in IEEE802.16e. CPN is a useful for simulation and compare protocol together so we use CPN tools in this paper.
