A unified setting for inference and decision: An argumentation-based approach

Inferring from inconsistency and making decisions are two problems which have always been treated separately by researchers in Artificial Intelligence. Consequently, different models have been proposed for each category. Different argumentation systems [2, 7, 10, 11] have been developed for handling inconsistency in knowledge bases. Recently, other argumentation systems [3, 4, 8] have been defined for making decisions under uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to present a general argumentation framework in which both inferring from inconsistency and decision making are captured. The proposed framework can be used for decision under uncertainty, multiple criteria decision, rule-based decision and finally case-based decision. Moreover, works on classical decision suppose that the information about environment is coherent, and this no longer required by this general framework.
