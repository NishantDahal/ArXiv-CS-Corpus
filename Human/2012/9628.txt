A Novel Approach for Handling Misbehaving Nodes in Behavior-Aware Mobile Networking

Profile-cast is a service paradigm within the communication framework of delay tolerant networks (DTN). Instead of using destination addresses to determine the final destination it uses similarity-based forwarding protocol. With the rise in popularity of various wireless networks, the need to make wireless technologies robust, resilient to attacks and failure becomes mandatory. One issue that remains to be addressed in behavioral networks is node co-operation in forwarding packets. Nodes might behave selfishly (due to bandwidth preservation, energy /power constraints) or maliciously by dropping packets or not forwarding them to other nodes based on profile similarity. In both cases the net result is degradation in the performance of the network. It is our goal to show that the performance of the behavioral network can be improved by employing self-policing scheme that would detect node misbehavior and then decide how to tackle them in order to ensure node cooperation or so that the overall performance does not fall below a certain threshold. For this various existing self-policing techniques which are in use in ad-hoc networks will be first tried on this behavioral scenario.At various stages simulation would be used to measure performances of the network under different constraints, and after subjected to different techniques
