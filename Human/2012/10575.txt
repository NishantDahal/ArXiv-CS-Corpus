Using Wikipedia to Boost SVD Recommender Systems

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has been used successfully in recent years in the area of recommender systems. In this paper we present how this model can be extended to consider both user ratings and information from Wikipedia. By mapping items to Wikipedia pages and quantifying their similarity, we are able to use this information in order to improve recommendation accuracy, especially when the sparsity is high. Another advantage of the proposed approach is the fact that it can be easily integrated into any other SVD implementation, regardless of additional parameters that may have been added to it. Preliminary experimental results on the MovieLens dataset are encouraging.
