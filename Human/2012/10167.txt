Elaboration of a new tool for weather data sequences generation

This paper deals about the presentation of a new software RUNEOLE used to provide weather data in buildings physics. RUNEOLE associates three modules leading to the description, the modelling and the generation of weather data. The first module is dedicated to the description of each climatic variable included in the database. Graphic representation is possible (with histograms for example). Mathematical tools used to compare statistical distributions, determine daily characteristic evolutions, find typical days, and the correlations between the different climatic variables have been elaborated in the second module. Artificial weather datafiles adapted to different simulation codes are available at the issue of the third module. This tool can then be used in HVAC system evaluation, or in the study of thermal comfort. The studied buildings can then be tested under different thermal, aeraulic, and radiative solicitations, leading to a best understanding of their behaviour for example in humid climates.
