Performance Evaluation of QoS Parameters in Dynamic Spectrum Sharing for Heterogeneous Wireless Communication Networks

Cognitive radio nodes have been proposed as means to improve the spectrum utilization. It reuses the spectrum of a primary service provider under the condition that the primary service provider services are not harmfully interrupted. A cognitive radio can sense its operating environment's conditions and it is able to reconfigure itself and to communicate with other counterparts based on the status of the environment and also the requirements of the user to meet the optimal communication conditions and to keep quality of service (QoS) as high as possible. The efficiency of spectrum sharing can be improved by minimizing the interference. The Utility function that captures the cooperative behavior to minimize the interference and the satisfaction to improve the throughput is investigated. The dynamic spectrum sharing algorithm can maintain the quality of service (QoS) of each network while the effective spectrum utilisation is improved under a fluctuation traffic environment when the available spectrum is limited.
