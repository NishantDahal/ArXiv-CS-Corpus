An Efficient Soft Decoder of Block Codes Based on Compact Genetic Algorithm

Soft-decision decoding is NP-hard problem of great interest to developers of communication system. We present an efficient soft-decision decoding of linear block codes based on compact genetic algorithm (cGA) and compare its performance with various other decoding algorithms including Shakeel algorithms. The proposed algorithm uses the dual code in contrast to Shakeel algorithm that uses the code itself. Hence, this new approach reduces the decoding complexity of high rates codes. The complexity and an optimized version of this new algorithm is also presented and discussed.
