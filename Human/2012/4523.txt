The Planetary Project: Towards eMath3.0

The Planetary project develops a general framework - the Planetary system - for social semantic portals that support users in interacting with STEM (Science/Technology/Engineering/Mathematics) documents. Developed from an initial attempt to replace the aging portal of PlanetMath.org with a mashup of existing MKM technologies, the Planetary system is now in a state, where it can serve as a basis for various eMath3.0 portals, ranging from eLearning systems over scientific archives to semantic help systems.
