Optimal Index Codes for a Class of Multicast Networks with Receiver Side Information

This paper studies a special class of multicast index coding problems where a sender transmits messages to multiple receivers, each with some side information. Here, each receiver knows a unique message a priori, and there is no restriction on how many messages each receiver requests from the sender. For this class of multicast index coding problems, we obtain the optimal index code, which has the shortest codelength for which the sender needs to send in order for all receivers to obtain their (respective) requested messages. This is the first class of index coding problems where the optimal index codes are found. In addition, linear index codes are shown to be optimal for this class of index coding problems.
