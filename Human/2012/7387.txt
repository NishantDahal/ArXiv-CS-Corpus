Vertical Handoff Decision Based On Genetic Algorithm in 4G Network

The rapid improvement of the mobile generations was for the purpose of supporting as many mobile devices as possible that could benefit the users at anytime and anywhere in terms of common practical applications such as internet access, video-on-demand, video conferencing system and many more applications. In this paper, a review for the mobile generations in the wireless communications is pre-sented in order to highlight and compare the issues and challenges that are involved in each generation starting from the earlier generations along to the following generations and finally till the 4th Generation (4G). The 4G wireless network is intended to complement and replace the current generations. Accessing information anywhere, anytime, with a seamless connection to a wide range of information and services, and receiving a large volume of information, data, pictures, video, and so on, are the keys features of 4G. Based on the developing trends of mobile communication, 4G will have broader bandwidth, higher data rate, and smoother and quicker handoff to provide seamless service across a multitude of wireless systems and networks. One of the major issues of seamless mobility is handoff management. It is a major challenge to design intelligent handoff management schemes for 4G-systems. In this paper we have presented the design of an adaptive multi-attribute vertical handoff decision algorithm based on genetic algorithm which is both cost effective and useful.
