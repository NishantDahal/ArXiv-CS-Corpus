Ontology for Mobile Phone Operating Systems

This ongoing study deals with an important part of a line of research that constitutes a challenging burden. It is an initial investigation into the development of a Holistic Framework for Cellular Communication (HFCC). The main purpose is to establish mechanisms by which existing wireless cellular communication components and models can work holistically together. It demonstrates that establishing a mathematical framework that allows existing cellular communication technologies (and tools supporting those technologies) to seamlessly interact is technically feasible. The longer-term future goals are to actually improve the interoperability, the efficiency of mobile communication, calls quality, and reliability by applying the framework to specific development efforts.
