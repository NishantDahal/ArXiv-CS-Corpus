Order-Degree Curves for Hypergeometric Creative Telescoping

Creative telescoping applied to a bivariate proper hypergeometric term produces linear recurrence operators with polynomial coefficients, called telescopers. We provide bounds for the degrees of the polynomials appearing in these operators. Our bounds are expressed as curves in the (r,d)-plane which assign to every order r a bound on the degree d of the telescopers. These curves are hyperbolas, which reflect the phenomenon that higher order telescopers tend to have lower degree, and vice versa.
