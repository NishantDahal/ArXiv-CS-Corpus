Multilateration: Methods For Clustering Intersection Points For Wireless Sensor Networks Localization With Distance Estimation Error

In this paper we describe three methods for localizing a wireless sensor network node, using anchor nodes in its neighbourhood, when there is an error in distance estimation present. We use the intersection points of the circles formed with the estimated distances from each anchors and we apply different methods to form clusters. We then use the cluster points to calculate the final position.
