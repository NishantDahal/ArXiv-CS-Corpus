Proceedings 7th International Workshop on Developments of Computational Methods

This volume contains the proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Developments in Computational Models (DCM 2011) which was held on Sunday July 3, 2011, in Zurich, Switzerland, as a satelite workshop of ICALP 2011.
  Recently several new models of computation have emerged, for instance for bio-computing and quantum-computing,  and in addition traditional models of computation have been adapted to accommodate new demands or capabilities of computer systems. The aim of DCM is to bring together researchers who are  currently developing new computational models or new  features for traditional computational models, in order  to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for  presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable  newcomers to learn about current activities in this area.
