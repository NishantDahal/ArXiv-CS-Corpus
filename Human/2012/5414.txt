Kolmogorov Complexity: Clustering Objects and Similarity

The clustering objects has become one of themes in many studies, and do not few researchers use the similarity to cluster the instances automatically. However, few research consider using Kommogorov Complexity to get information about objects from documents, such as Web pages, where the rich information from an approach proved to be difficult to. In this paper, we proposed a similarity measure from Kolmogorov Complexity, and we demonstrate the possibility of exploiting features from Web based on hit counts for objects of Indonesia Intellectual.
