Fabrication of Message Digest to Authenticate Audio Signals with Alternation of Coefficients of Harmonics in Multi-Stages (MDAC)

Providing security to audio songs for maintaining its intellectual property right (IPR) is one of chanllenging fields in commercial world especially in creative industry. In this paper, an effective approach has been incorporated to fabricate authentication of audio song through application of message digest method with alternation of coefficients of harmonics in multi-stages of higher frequency domain without affecting its audible quality. Decomposing constituent frequency components of song signal using Fourier transform with generating secret code via applying message digest followed by alternating coefficients of specific harmonics in multi-stages generates a secret code and this unique code is utilized to detect the originality of the song. A comparative study has been made with similar existing techniques and experimental results are also supported with mathematical formula based on Microsoft WAVE (".wav") stereo sound file.
