A Network Calculus Approach for the Analysis of Multi-Hop Fading Channels

A fundamental problem in the delay and backlog analysis across multi-hop paths in wireless networks is how to account for the random properties of the wireless channel. Since the usual statistical models for radio signals in a propagation environment do not lend themselves easily to a description of the available service rate on a wireless link, the performance analysis of wireless networks has resorted to higher-layer abstractions, e.g., using Markov chain models. In this work, we propose a network calculus that can incorporate common statistical models of fading channels and obtain statistical bounds on delay and backlog across multiple nodes. We conduct the analysis in a transfer domain, which we refer to as the `SNR domain', where the service process at a link is characterized by the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. We discover that, in the transfer domain, the network model is governed by a dioid algebra, which we refer to as (min,x)-algebra. Using this algebra we derive the desired delay and backlog bounds. An application of the analysis is demonstrated for a simple multi-hop network with Rayleigh fading channels and for a network with cross traffic.
