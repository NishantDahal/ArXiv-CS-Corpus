Int√©gration des intergiciels de grilles de PC dans le nuage SlapOS : le cas de BOINC

In this article we describe the problems and solutions related to the integration of desktop grid middleware in a cloud, in this case the open source SlapOS cloud. We focus on the issues about recipes that describe the integration and the problem of the confinement of execution. They constitute two aspects of service-oriented architecture and Cloud Computing. These two issues solved with SlapOS are not in relation to what is traditionally done in the clouds because we do not rely on virtual machines and, there is no data center (as defined in cloud). Moreover, we show that from the initial deployment model we take into account not only Web applications, B2B applications... but also applications from the field of grids; here desktop grid middleware which is a case study.
