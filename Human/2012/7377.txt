Image Classification and Optimized Image Reproduction

By taking into account the properties and limitations of the human visual system, images can be more efficiently compressed, colors more accurately reproduced, prints better rendered. To show all these advantages in this paper new adapted color charts have been created based on technical and visual image category analysis. A number of tests have been carried out using extreme images with their key information strictly in dark and light areas. It was shown that the image categorization using the adapted color charts improves the analysis of relevant image information with regard to both the image gradation and the detail reproduction. The images with key information in hi-key areas were also test printed using the adapted color charts.
