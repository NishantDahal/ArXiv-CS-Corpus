Continuum Percolation Thresholds in Two Dimensions

A wide variety of methods have been used to compute percolation thresholds. In lattice percolation, the most powerful of these methods consists of microcanonical simulations using the union-find algorithm to efficiently determine the connected clusters, and (in two dimensions) using exact values from conformal field theory for the probability, at the phase transition, that various kinds of wrapping clusters exist on the torus. We apply this approach to percolation in continuum models, finding overlaps between objects with real-valued positions and orientations. In particular, we find precise values of the percolation transition for disks, squares, rotated squares, and rotated sticks in two dimensions, and confirm that these transitions behave as conformal field theory predicts. The running time and memory use of our algorithm are essentially linear as a function of the number of objects at criticality.
