Impact of Different Spreading Codes Using FEC on DWT Based MC-CDMA System

The effect of different spreading codes in DWT based MC-CDMA wireless communication system is investigated. In this paper, we present the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of different spreading codes (Walsh-Hadamard code, Orthogonal gold code and Golay complementary sequences) using Forward Error Correction (FEC) of the proposed system. The data is analyzed and is compared among different spreading codes in both coded and uncoded cases. It is found via computer simulation that the performance of the proposed coded system is much better than that of the uncoded system irrespective of the spreading codes and all the spreading codes show approximately similar nature for both coded and uncoded in all modulation schemes.
