Self Managed Security Cell, a security model for the Internet of Things and Services

The Internet of Things and Services is a rapidly growing concept that illustrates that the ever increasing amount of physical items of our daily life which become addressable through a network could be made more easily manageable and usable through the use of Services. This surge of exposed resources along with the level of privacy and value of the information they hold, together with the increase of their usage make for an augmentation in the number of the security threats and violation attempts that existing security systems do not appear robust enough to address. In this paper, the authors underline this increase in risk and identify the requirements for resources to be more resilient in this type of environment while keeping an important level of flexibility. In addition, the authors propose an architectural model of Self Managed Security Cell, which leverages on current knowledge in large scale security systems, information management and autonomous systems.
