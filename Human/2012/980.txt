Attack on Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Integers

This paper presents a heuristic attack on the fully homomorphic encryption over the integers by using lattice reduction algorithm. Our result shows that the FHE in [DGHV10] is not secure for some parameter settings. We also present an improvement scheme to avoid the lattice attack in this paper.
