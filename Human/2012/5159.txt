Uplink Performance Analysis of Multicell MU-MIMO Systems with ZF Receivers

We consider the uplink of a multicell multiuser multiple-input multiple-output system where the channel experiences both small and large-scale fading. The data detection is done by using the linear zero-forcing technique, assuming the base station (BS) has perfect channel state information. We derive new, exact closed-form expressions for the uplink rate, symbol error rate, and outage probability per user, as well as a lower bound on the achievable rate. This bound is very tight and becomes exact in the large-number-of-antennas limit. We further study the asymptotic system performance in the regimes of high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), large number of antennas, and large number of users per cell. We show that at high SNRs, the system is interference-limited and hence, we cannot improve the system performance by increasing the transmit power of each user. Instead, by increasing the number of BS antennas, the effects of interference and noise can be reduced, thereby improving the system performance. We demonstrate that, with very large antenna arrays at the BS, the transmit power of each user can be made inversely proportional to the number of BS antennas while maintaining a desired quality-of-service. Numerical results are presented to verify our analysis.
