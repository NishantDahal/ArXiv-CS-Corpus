Proceedings Combined 19th International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency and 9th Workshop on Structured Operational Semantics

This volume contains the proceedings of the Combined 19th International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency and the 9th Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics (EXPRESS/SOS 2012), which took place on 3rd September 2012 in Newcastle upon Tyne, as a satellite workshop of CONCUR 2012. The EXPRESS workshop series aims at bringing together researchers interested in the expressiveness of various formal systems and semantic notions, particularly in the field of concurrency. The SOS workshop series aims at being a forum for researchers, students and practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for future investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics. In 2012, the EXPRESS and SOS communities organized a joint EXPRESS/SOS 2012 workshop on the formal semantics of systems and programming concepts, and on the expressiveness of mathematical models of computation.
