Five Modulus Method For Image Compression

Data is compressed by reducing its redundancy, but this also makes the data less reliable, more prone to errors. In this paper a novel approach of image compression based on a new method that has been created for image compression which is called Five Modulus Method (FMM). The new method consists of converting each pixel value in an 8-by-8 block into a multiple of 5 for each of the R, G and B arrays. After that, the new values could be divided by 5 to get new values which are 6-bit length for each pixel and it is less in storage space than the original value which is 8-bits. Also, a new protocol for compression of the new values as a stream of bits has been presented that gives the opportunity to store and transfer the new compressed image easily.
