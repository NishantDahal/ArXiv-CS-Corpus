Improved Balas and Mazzola Linearization for Quadratic 0-1 Programs with Application in a New Cutting Plane Algorithm

Balas and Mazzola linearization (BML) is widely used in devising cutting plane algorithms for quadratic 0-1 programs. In this article, we improve BML by first strengthening the primal formulation of BML and then considering the dual formulation. Additionally, a new cutting plane algorithm is proposed.
