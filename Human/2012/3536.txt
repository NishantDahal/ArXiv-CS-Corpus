A Novel Video Compression Approach Based on Underdetermined Blind Source Separation

This paper develops a new video compression approach based on underdetermined blind source separation. Underdetermined blind source separation, which can be used to efficiently enhance the video compression ratio, is combined with various off-the-shelf codecs in this paper. Combining with MPEG-2, video compression ratio could be improved slightly more than 33%. As for combing with H.264, 4X~12X more compression ratio could be achieved with acceptable PSNR, according to different kinds of video sequences.
