A Novel MCMC Based Receiver for Large-Scale Uplink Multiuser MIMO Systems

In this paper, we propose low complexity algorithms based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique for signal detection and channel estimation on the uplink in large scale multiuser multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with tens to hundreds of antennas at the base station (BS) and similar number of uplink users. A BS receiver that employs a randomized sampling method (which makes a probabilistic choice between Gibbs sampling and random sampling in each iteration) for detection and a Gibbs sampling based method for channel estimation is proposed. The algorithm proposed for detection alleviates the stalling problem encountered at high SNRs in conventional MCMC algorithm and achieves near-optimal performance in large systems. A novel ingredient in the detection algorithm that is responsible for achieving near-optimal performance at low complexities is the joint use of a {\it randomized MCMC (R-MCMC) strategy} coupled with a {\it multiple restart strategy} with an efficient restart criterion. Near-optimal detection performance is demonstrated for large number of BS antennas and users (e.g., 64, 128, 256 BS antennas/users). The proposed MCMC based channel estimation algorithm refines an initial estimate of the channel obtained during pilot phase through iterations with R-MCMC detection during data phase. In time division duplex (TDD) systems where channel reciprocity holds, these channel estimates can be used for multiuser MIMO precoding on the downlink. Further, we employ this receiver architecture in the frequency domain for receiving cyclic prefixed single carrier (CPSC) signals on frequency selective fading between users and the BS. The proposed receiver achieves performance that is near optimal and close to that achieved with perfect channel knowledge.
