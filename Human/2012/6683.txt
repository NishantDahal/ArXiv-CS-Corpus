Small Strong Epsilon Nets

Let P be a set of n points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. A point x is said to be a centerpoint of P if x is contained in every convex object that contains more than $dn\over d+1$ points of P. We call a point x a strong centerpoint for a family of objects $\mathcal{C}$ if $x \in P$ is contained in every object $C \in \mathcal{C}$ that contains more than a constant fraction of points of P. A strong centerpoint does not exist even for halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We prove that a strong centerpoint exists for axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and give exact bounds. We then extend this to small strong $ε$-nets in the plane and prove upper and lower bounds for $ε_i^\mathcal{S}$ where $\mathcal{S}$ is the family of axis-parallel rectangles, halfspaces and disks. Here $ε_i^\mathcal{S}$ represents the smallest real number in $[0,1]$ such that there exists an $ε_i^\mathcal{S}$-net of size i with respect to $\mathcal{S}$.
