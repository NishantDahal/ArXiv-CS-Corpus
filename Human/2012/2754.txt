Galaxysearch - Discovering the Knowledge of Many by Using Wikipedia as a Meta-Searchindex

We propose a dynamic map of knowledge generated from Wikipedia pages and the Web URLs contained therein. GalaxySearch provides answers to the questions we don't know how to ask, by constructing a semantic network of the most relevant pages in Wikipedia related to a search term. This search graph is constructed based on the Wikipedia bidirectional link structure, the most recent edits on the pages, the importance of the page, and the article quality; search results are then ranked by the centrality of their network position. GalaxySearch provides the results in three related ways: (1) WikiSearch - identifying the most prominent Wikipedia pages and Weblinks for a chosen topic, (2) WikiMap - creating a visual temporal map of the changes in the semantic network generated by the search results over the lifetime of the returned Wikipedia articles, and (3) WikiPulse - finding the most recent and most relevant changes and updates about a topic.
