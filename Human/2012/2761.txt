Broadcast Search in Innovation Contests: Case for Hybrid Models

Organizations use broadcast search to identify new avenues of innovation. Research on innovation contests provides insights on why excellent ideas are created in a broadcast search. However, there is little research on how excellent ideas are selected. Drawing from the brainstorming literature we find that the selection of excellent ideas needs further investigation. We propose that a hybrid model may lead to selection of better ideas. The hybrid model is a broadcast search approach that exploits the strengths of different actors and procedures in idea generation and the selection phase.
