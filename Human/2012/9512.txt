Deep Attribute Networks

Obtaining compact and discriminative features is one of the major challenges in many of the real-world image classification tasks such as face verification and object recognition. One possible approach is to represent input image on the basis of high-level features that carry semantic meaning which humans can understand. In this paper, a model coined deep attribute network (DAN) is proposed to address this issue. For an input image, the model outputs the attributes of the input image without performing any classification. The efficacy of the proposed model is evaluated on unconstrained face verification and real-world object recognition tasks using the LFW and the a-PASCAL datasets. We demonstrate the potential of deep learning for attribute-based classification by showing comparable results with existing state-of-the-art results. Once properly trained, the DAN is fast and does away with calculating low-level features which are maybe unreliable and computationally expensive.
