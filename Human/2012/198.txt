Energy Efficient Iterative Waterfilling for the MIMO Broadcasting Channels

Optimizing energy efficiency (EE) for the MIMO broadcasting channels (BC) is considered in this paper, where a practical power model is taken into account. Although the EE of the MIMO BC is non-concave, we reformulate it as a quasiconcave function based on the uplink-downlink duality. After that, an energy efficient iterative waterfilling scheme is proposed based on the block-coordinate ascent algorithm to obtain the optimal transmission policy efficiently, and the solution is proved to be convergent. Through simulations, we validate the efficiency of the proposed scheme and discuss the system parameters' effect on the EE.
