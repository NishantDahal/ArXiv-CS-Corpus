Blind Channel Estimation Enhancement for Mimo- OFDM Systems under High Mobility Conditions

In this paper, we propose an enhancement of a blind channel estimator based on a subspace approach in a MIMO OFDM context (Multi Input Multi Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) in high mobility scenario. As known, the combination between the MIMO context and the OFDM system has stimulated mainly the evolution of the fourth generation broadband wireless communications. The simulations results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach for a 16 QAM modulation scheme and had been evaluated in term of bit error rate BER and mean square error MSE versus the signal to noise ratio SNR.
