An Overview of the AAVSO's Information Technology Infrastructure From 1967 to 1997

Computer technology and data processing swept both society and the sciences like a wave in the latter half of the 20th century. We trace the AAVSO's usage of computational and data processing technology from its beginnings in 1967, through 1997. We focus on equipment, people, and the purpose such computational power was put to, and compare and contrast the organization's use of hardware and software with that of the wider industry.
