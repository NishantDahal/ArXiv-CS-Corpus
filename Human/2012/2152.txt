Towards an intelligence based conceptual framework for e-maintenance

Since the time when concept of e-maintenance was introduced, most of the works insisted on the relevance of the underlying Information and Communication Technologies infrastructure. Through a review of current e-maintenance conceptual approaches and realizations, this paper aims to reconsider the predominance of ICT within e-maintenance projects and literature. The review brings to light the importance of intelligence as a fundamental dimension of e-maintenance that is to be led in a holistic predefined manner rather than isolated efforts within ICT driven approaches. As a contribution towards an intelligence based e-maintenance conceptual framework, a proposal is outlined in this paper to model e-maintenance system as an intelligent system. The proposed frame is based on CogAff architecture for intelligent agents. Within the proposed frame, more importance was reserved to the environment that the system is to be continuously aware of: Plant Environment, Internal and External Enterprise Environment and Human Environment. In addition to the abilities required for internal coherent behavior of the system, requirements for maintenance activities support are also mapped within the same frame according to corresponding levels of management. A case study was detailed in this paper sustaining the applicability of the proposal in relation to the classification of existing e-maintenance platforms. However, more work is needed to enhance exhaustiveness of the frame to serve as a comparison tool of existing e-maintenance systems. At the conceptual level, our future work is to use the proposed frame in an e-maintenance project.
