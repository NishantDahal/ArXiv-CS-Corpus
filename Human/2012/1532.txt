On Shift Spaces with Algebraic Structure

We investigate subshifts with a general algebraic structure and cellular automata on them, with an emphasis on (order-theoretic) lattices. Our main results concern the characterization of Boolean algebraic subshifts, conditions for algebraic subshifts to be recoded into cellwise algebras and the limit dynamics of homomorphic cellular automata on lattice subshifts.
