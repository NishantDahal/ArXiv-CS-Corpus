Playing Pushdown Parity Games in a Hurry

We continue the investigation of finite-duration variants of infinite-duration games by extending known results for games played on finite graphs to those played on infinite ones. In particular, we establish an equivalence between pushdown parity games and a finite-duration variant. This allows us to determine the winner of a pushdown parity game by solving a reachability game on a finite tree.
