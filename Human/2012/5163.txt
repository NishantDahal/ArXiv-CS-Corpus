Equivalence of SLNR Precoder and RZF Precoder in Downlink MU-MIMO Systems

The signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) precoder is widely used for MU-MIMO systems in many works, and observed with improved performance from zeroforcing (ZF) precoder. Our work proofs SLNR precoder is completely equivalent to conventional regulated ZF (RZF) precoder, which has significant gain over ZF precoder at low SNRs. Therefore, with our conclusion, the existing performance analysis about RZF precoder can be readily applicable to SLNR precoder.
