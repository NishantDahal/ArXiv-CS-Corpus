Math world: A game-based 3D Virtual Learning Environment (3D VLE) for second graders

This paper intends to introduce a game-based 3D Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) to second graders. The impetus arose from the need to make learning in mathematics more effective and interesting through multimedia. Applied in a game, the basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are expected to performed by learners as they represent themselves as avatars while they immerse in a quest of digital objects in the VLE called Math World. Educational attributes such as mentality change, emotional fulfillment, knowledge enhancement, thinking skills development, and bodily coordination are evaluated to ensure learning effectiveness. Also, game playability measured in terms of game plays, story, mechanics and interface usability are examined for its educative design. With an aggregate of these enhanced indices, results attest that objectives were met while making mathematics an interesting, motivating and enjoyable subject, hence VLE a significant tool to complement the conventional approaches of teaching.
