On Achievable Schemes of Interference Alignment in Constant Channels via Finite Amplify-and-Forward Relays

This paper elaborates on the achievable schemes of interference alignment in constant channels via finite amplify-and-forward (AF) relays. Consider $K$ sources communicating with $K$ destinations without direct links besides the relay connections. The total number of relays is finite. The objective is to achieve interference alignment for all user pairs to obtain half of their interference-free degrees of freedom. In general, two strategies are employed: coding at the edge and coding in the middle, in which relays show different roles. The contributions are that two fundamental and critical elements are captured to enable interference alignment in this network: channel randomness or relativity; subspace dimension suppression.
