FHHOP: A Factored Hybrid Heuristic Online Planning Algorithm for Large POMDPs

Planning in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) remains a challenging topic in the artificial intelligence community, in spite of recent impressive progress in approximation techniques. Previous research has indicated that online planning approaches are promising in handling large-scale POMDP domains efficiently as they make decisions "on demand" instead of proactively for the entire state space. We present a Factored Hybrid Heuristic Online Planning (FHHOP) algorithm for large POMDPs. FHHOP gets its power by combining a novel hybrid heuristic search strategy with a recently developed factored state representation. On several benchmark problems, FHHOP substantially outperformed state-of-the-art online heuristic search approaches in terms of both scalability and quality.
