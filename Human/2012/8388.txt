Timing Constraints Support on Petri-Net Model for Healthcare System Design

The worldwide healthcare organizations are facing a number of daunting challenges forcing systems to benefit from modern technologies and telecom capabilities. Hence, systems evolution through extension of the existing information technology infrastructure becomes one of the most challenging aspects of healthcare. In this paper, we present a newly architecture for evolving healthcare systems towards a service-oriented architecture. Since healthcare process exists in temporal context, timing constraints satisfiability verification techniques are growing to enable designers to test and repair design errors. Thanks to Hierarchical Timed Predicate Petri-Net based conceptual framework, desirable properties such as deadlock free and safe as well as timing constraints satisfiability can be easily checked by designer.
