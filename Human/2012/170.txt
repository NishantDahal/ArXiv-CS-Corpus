Learners' Quanta based Design of a Learning Management System

In this paper IEEE Learning Technology System Architecture (LTSA) for LMS software has been analyzed. It has been observed that LTSA is too abstract to be adapted in a uniform way by LMS developers. A Learners' Quanta based high level design that satisfies the IEEE LTSA standard has been proposed for future development of efficient LMS software. A hybrid model of learning fitting into LTSA model has also been proposed while designing.
