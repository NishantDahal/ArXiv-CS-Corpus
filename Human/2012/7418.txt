DolNet: A Division Of Labour Based Distributed Object Oriented Software Process Model

Distributed Software Development today is in its childhood and not too widespread as a method of developing software in the global IT Industry. In this context, Petrinets are a mathematical model for describing distributed systems theoretically, whereas AttNets are one of their offshoots. But development of true distributed software is limited to network operating systems majorly. Software that runs on many machines with separate programs for each machine, are very few. This paper introduces and defines Distributed Object Oriented Software Engineering DOOSE as a new field in software engineering. The paper further gives a Distributed Object Oriented Software Process Model DOOSPM, called the DolNet, which describes how work may be done by a software development organization while working on Distributed Object Oriented DOO Projects.
