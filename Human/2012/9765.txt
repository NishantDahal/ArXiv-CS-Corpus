Optimal Covering with Mobile Sensors in an Unbounded Region

Covering a bounded region with minimum number of homogeneous sensor nodes is a NP-complete problem \cite{Li09}. In this paper we have proposed an {\it id} based distributed algorithm for optimal coverage in an unbounded region. The proposed algorithm guarantees maximum spreading in $O(\sqrt{n})$ rounds without creating any coverage hole. The algorithm executes in synchronous rounds without exchanging any message.
  We have also explained how our proposed algorithm can achieve optimal energy consumption and handle random sensor node deployment for optimal spreading.
