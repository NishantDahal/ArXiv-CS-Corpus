A Pseudorandom Generator for Polynomial Threshold Functions of Gaussian with Subpolynomial Seed Length

We develop a pseudorandom generator that fools degree-$d$ polynomial threshold functions in $n$ variables with respect to the Gaussian distribution and has seed length $O_{c,d}(\log(n) Îµ^{-c})$.
