Decidability of All Minimal Models (Revised Version - 2012)

This unpublished note is an alternate, shorter (and hopefully more readable) proof of the decidability of all minimal models. The decidability follows from a proof of the existence of a cellular term in each observational equivalence class of a minimal model.
