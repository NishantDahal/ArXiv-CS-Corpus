A comparative study on face recognition techniques and neural network

In modern times, face recognition has become one of the key aspects of computer vision. There are at least two reasons for this trend; the first is the commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after years of research. Due to the very nature of the problem, computer scientists, neuro-scientists and psychologists all share a keen interest in this field. In plain words, it is a computer application for automatically identifying a person from a still image or video frame. One of the ways to accomplish this is by comparing selected features from the image and a facial database. There are hundreds if not thousand factors associated with this. In this paper some of the most common techniques available including applications of neural network in facial recognition are studied and compared with respect to their performance.
