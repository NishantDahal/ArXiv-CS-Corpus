The Rank of Tree-Automatic Linear Orderings

We generalise Delhommé's result that each tree-automatic ordinal is strictly below ω^ω^ω by showing that any tree-automatic linear ordering has FC-rank strictly below ω^ω. We further investigate a restricted form of tree-automaticity and prove that every linear ordering which admits a tree-automatic presentation of branching complexity at most k has FC-rank strictly below ω^k.
