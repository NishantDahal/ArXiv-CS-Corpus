Performance Evaluation of Hierarchical Publish-Subscribe Monitoring Architecture for Service-Oriented Applications

Contemporary high-performance service-oriented applications demand a performance efficient run-time monitoring. In this paper, we analyze a hierarchical publish-subscribe architecture for monitoring service-oriented applications. The analyzed architecture is based on a tree topology and publish-subscribe communication model for aggregation of distributed monitoring data. In order to satisfy interoperability and platform independence of service-orientation, monitoring reports are represented as XML documents. Since XML formatting introduces a significant processing and network load, we analyze the performance of monitoring architecture with respect to the number of monitored nodes, the load of system machines, and the overall latency of the monitoring system.
