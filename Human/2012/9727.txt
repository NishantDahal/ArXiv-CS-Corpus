Project G.N.O.S.I.S.: Geographical Network Of Synoptic Information System

Everybody knows how much synoptic maps are useful today. An excellent example above all is Google Earth: its simplicity and friendly interface allows every user to have the Earth maps ready in just one simple layout; nevertheless a crucial dimension is missing in Google Earth: the time. This doesn't mean we simply aim to add history to Google Earth (though it could be already a nice goal): the main idea behind GNOSIS project is to produce applications to "dress up" the Globe with a set of skin-maps representing the most various different kind of histories like the evolution of geology, genetics, agriculture, ethnology, linguistics, musicology, metallurgy and so forth, in time. It may be interesting in the near future to have such a possibility to watch on the map the positions and movements of the armies during the battles of Waterloo or Thermopylae, the spreading of the cultivation of corn in time, the rise and fall of Roman Empire or the diffusion of Smallpox together with the spread of a religion, a specific dialect, the early pottery techniques or the natural resources available to pre-Columbian civilizations on a Google-Earth-map-like, that is to say to have at one's hand the ultimate didactic-enciclopedic tool. To do so we foresee the use of a general-purpose intermediate/high level programming language, possibly object-oriented such C++ or Java.
