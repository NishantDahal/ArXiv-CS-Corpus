Identity-based Trusted Authentication in Wireless Sensor Network

Secure communication mechanisms in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been widely deployed to ensure confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of the nodes and data. Recently many WSNs applications rely on trusted communication to ensure large user acceptance. Indeed, the trusted relationship thus far can only be achieved through Trust Management System (TMS) or by adding external security chip on the WSN platform. In this study an alternative mechanism is proposed to accomplish trusted communication between sensors based on the principles defined by Trusted Computing Group (TCG). The results of other related study have also been analyzed to validate and support our findings. Finally the proposed trusted mechanism is evaluated for the potential application on resource constraint devices by quantifying their power consumption on selected major processes. The result proved the proposed scheme can establish trust in WSN with less computation and communication and most importantly eliminating the need for neighboring evaluation for TMS or relying on external security chip.
