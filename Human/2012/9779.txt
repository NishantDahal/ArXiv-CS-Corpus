Reconciling complex organizations and data management: the Panopticon paradigm

These last years, main IT companies have build software solutions and change management plans promoting data quality management within organizations concerned by the enhancement of their business intelligence system. These offers are closely similar data governance schemes based on a common paradigm called Master Data Management. These schemes appear generally inappropriate to the context of complex extended organizations. On the other hand, the community-based data governance schemes have shown their own efficiency to contribute to the reliability of data in digital social networks, as well as their ability to meet user expectations. After a brief analysis of the very specific constraints weighting on extended organization s data governance, and of peculiarities of monitoring and regulatory processes associated to management control and IT within these, we propose a new scheme inspired by Foucaldian analysis on governmentality: the Panopticon data governance paradigm.
