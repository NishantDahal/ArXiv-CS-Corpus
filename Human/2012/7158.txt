Coding the Beams: Improving Beamforming Training in mmWave Communication System

The mmWave communication system is operating at a regime with high number of antennas and very limited number of RF analog chains. Large number of antennas are used to extend the communication range for recovering the high path loss while fewer RF analog chains are designed to reduce transmit and processing power and hardware complexity. In this regime, typical MIMO algorithms are not applicable.
  Before any communication starts, devices are needed to align their beam pointing angles towards each other. An efficient searching protocol to obtain the best beam angle pair is therefore needed. It is called BeamForming (BF) training protocol.
  This paper presents a new BF training technique called beam coding. Each beam angle is assigned unique signature code. By coding multiple beam angles and steering at their angles simultaneously in a training packet, the best beam angle pair can be obtained in a few packets. The proposed BF training technique not only shows the robustness in non-line-of-sight environment, but also provides very flat power variations within a packet in contrast to the IEEE 802.11ad standard whose scheme may lead to large dynamic range of signals due to beam angles varying across a training packet.
