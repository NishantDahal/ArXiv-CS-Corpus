Exact Reconstruction Conditions for Regularized Modified Basis Pursuit

In this correspondence, we obtain exact recovery conditions for regularized modified basis pursuit (reg-mod-BP) and discuss when the obtained conditions are weaker than those for modified-CS or for basis pursuit (BP). The discussion is also supported by simulation comparisons. Reg-mod-BP provides a solution to the sparse recovery problem when both an erroneous estimate of the signal's support, denoted by $T$, and an erroneous estimate of the signal values on $T$ are available.
