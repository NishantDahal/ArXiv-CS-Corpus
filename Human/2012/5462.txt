An Authentication Protocol Based on Combined RFID-Biometric System RFID-Biometric System

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and biometric technologies saw fast evolutions during the last years and which are used in several applications, such as access control. Among important characteristics in the RFID tags, we mention the limitation of resources (memory, energy, ...). Our work focuses on the design of a RFID authentication protocol which uses biometric data and which confirms the secrecy, the authentication and the privacy. Our protocol requires a PRNG (Pseud-Random Number Generator), a robust hash function and Biometric hash function. The Biometric hash function is used to optimize and to protect biometric data. For Security analysis of protocol proposed, we will use AVISPA and SPAN tools to verify the authentication and the secrecy.
