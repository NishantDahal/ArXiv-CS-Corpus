Comments on Proakis Analysis of the Characteristic Function of Complex Gaussian Quadratic Forms

An analysis of the characteristic function of Gaussian quadratic forms is presented in [1] to study the performance of multichannel communication systems. This technical report reviews this analysis, obtaining alternative expressions to original ones in compact matrix format.
