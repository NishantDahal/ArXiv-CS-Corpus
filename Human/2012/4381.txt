IACTalks: an on-line archive of astronomy-related seminars

We present IACTalks, a free and open access seminars archive (http://iactalks.iac.es) aimed at promoting astronomy and the exchange of ideas by providing high-quality scientific seminars to the astronomical community. The archive of seminars and talks given at the Instituto de Astrofi√≠sica de Canarias goes back to 2008. Over 360 talks and seminars are now freely available by streaming over the internet. We describe the user interface, which includes two video streams, one showing the speaker, the other the presentation. A search function is available, and seminars are indexed by keywords and in some cases by series, such as special training courses or the 2011 Winter School of Astrophysics, on secular evolution of galaxies. The archive is made available as an open resource, to be used by scientists and the public.
