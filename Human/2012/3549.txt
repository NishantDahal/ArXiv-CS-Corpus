On Murty-Simon Conjecture

A graph is diameter two edge-critical if its diameter is two and the deletion of any edge increases the diameter. Murty and Simon conjectured that the number of edges in a diameter two edge-critical graph on $n$ vertices is at most $\lfloor \frac{n^{2}}{4} \rfloor$ and the extremal graph is the complete bipartite graph $K_{\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor, \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil}$. In the series papers [8-10], the Murty-Simon Conjecture stated by Haynes et al is not the original conjecture, indeed, it is only for the diameter two edge-critical graphs of even order. Haynes et al proved the conjecture for the graphs whose complements have diameter three but only with even vertices. In this paper, we prove the Murty-Simon Conjecture for the graphs whose complements have diameter three, not only with even vertices but also odd ones.
