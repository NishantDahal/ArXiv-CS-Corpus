Methods of QoS improvement for P2P IPTV based on traffic modelling

Over the last years many technological advances were introduced in Internet television to meet user needs and expectations. However due to an overwhelming bandwidth requirements traditional IP-based television service based on simple client-server approach remains restricted to small group of clients. In such situation the use of the peer-to-peer overlay paradigm to deliver live television on the Internet is gaining increasing attention. Unfortunately the current Internet infrastructure provides only best effort services for this kind of applications and do not offer quality of service.
  This paper is a research proposition which presents potential solutions for efficient IPTV streaming over P2P networks. We assume that the solutions will not directly modify existing P2P IPTV protocols but rather will be dedicated for a network engineer or an Internet service provider which will be able to introduce and configure the proposed mechanisms in network routers.
