A low power high bandwidth four quadrant analog multiplier in 32 nm CNFET technology

Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNFET) is a promising new technology that overcomes several limitations of traditional silicon integrated circuit technology. In recent years, the potential of CNFET for analog circuit applications has been explored. This paper proposes a novel four quadrant analog multiplier design using CNFETs. The simulation based on 32nm CNFET technology shows that the proposed multiplier has very low harmonic distortion (<0.45%), large input range ({\pm}400mV), large bandwidth (~50GHz) and low power consumption (~247Î¼W), while operating at a supply voltage of {\pm}0.9V.
