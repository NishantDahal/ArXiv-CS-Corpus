Performance Evaluation of DOA Estimation using MATLAB

This paper presents the performance analysis of directions of arrival estimation techniques, Subspace and the Non-Subspace methods. In this paper, exploring the analysis category of high resolution and super resolution algorithms, presentation of description, comparison and the performance and resolution analyses of these algorithms are made. Sensitivity to various perturbations and the effect of parameters related to the design of the sensor array itself such as the number of array elements and their spacing are also investigated.
