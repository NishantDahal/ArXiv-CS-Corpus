Description Logics with Fuzzy Concrete Domains

We present a fuzzy version of description logics with concrete domains. Main features are: (i) concept constructors are based on t-norm, t-conorm, negation and implication; (ii) concrete domains are fuzzy sets; (iii) fuzzy modifiers are allowed; and (iv) the reasoning algorithm is based on a mixture of completion rules and bounded mixed integer programming.
