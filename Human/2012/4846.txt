Implementation of the Domain-Specific Language EasyTime using a LISA Compiler Generator

A manually time-measuring tool in mass sporting competitions cannot be imagined nowadays because many modern disciplines, such as IronMan, take a long time and, therefore, demand additional reliability. Moreover, automatic timing devices, based on RFID technology, have become cheaper. However, these devices cannot operate stand-alone because they need a computer measuring system that is capable of processing the incoming events, encoding the results, assigning them to the correct competitor, sorting the results according to the achieved times, and then providing a printout of the results. In this article, the domain-specific language EasyTime is presented, which enables the controlling of an agent by writing the events in a database. In particular, we are focused on the implementation of EasyTime with a LISA tool that enables the automatic construction of compilers from language specifications using Attribute Grammars. By using of EasyTime, we can also decrease the number of measuring devices. Furthermore, EasyTime is universal and can be applied to many different sporting competitions in practice.
