Local and global moves on locally planar trivalent graphs, lambda calculus and $λ$-Scale

We give a description of local and global moves on a class of locally planar trivalent graphs and we show that it contains $λ$-Scale calculus, therefore in particular untyped lambda calculus. Surprisingly, the beta reduction rule comes from a local "sewing" transformation of trivalent locally planar graphs.
