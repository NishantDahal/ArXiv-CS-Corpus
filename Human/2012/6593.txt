Composite Design Pattern for Feature Oriented Service Injection and Composition of Web Services for Distributed Computing Systems with Service Oriented Architecture

With the advent of newly introduced programming models like Feature-Oriented Programming (FOP), we feel that it will be more flexible to include the new service invocation function into the service providing server as a Feature Module for the self-adaptive distributed systems. A composite design patterns shows a synergy that makes the composition more than just the sum of its parts which leads to ready-made software architectures. In this paper we describe the amalgamation of Visitor and Case-Based Reasoning Design Patterns to the development of the Service Invocation and Web Services Composition through SOA with the help of JWS technologies and FOP. As far as we know, there are no studies on composition of design patterns for self adaptive distributed computing domain. We have provided with the sample code developed for the application and simple UML class diagram is used to describe the architecture.
