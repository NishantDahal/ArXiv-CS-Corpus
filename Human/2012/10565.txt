Integrated Green Cloud Computing Architecture

Arbitrary usage of cloud computing, either private or public, can lead to uneconomical energy consumption in data processing, storage and communication. Hence, green cloud computing solutions aim not only to save energy but also reduce operational costs and carbon footprints on the environment. In this paper, an Integrated Green Cloud Architecture (IGCA) is proposed that comprises of a client-oriented Green Cloud Middleware to assist managers in better overseeing and configuring their overall access to cloud services in the greenest or most energy-efficient way. Decision making, whether to use local machine processing, private or public clouds, is smartly handled by the middleware using predefined system specifications such as service level agreement (SLA), Quality of service (QoS), equipment specifications and job description provided by IT department. Analytical model is used to show the feasibility to achieve efficient energy consumption while choosing between local, private and public Cloud service provider (CSP).
