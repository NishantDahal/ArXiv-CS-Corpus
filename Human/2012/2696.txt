Stimulus and correlation matching measurement technique in computer based characterization testing

Constructive theory of characterization test is considered. The theory is applicable to a nano devices characterization: current-voltage, Auger current dependence. Generally small response of device under test on an applied stimulus is masked by an unknown deterministic background and a random noise. Characterization test in this signal corruption scenario should be based on correlation measurement technique of device response on applied optimal stimulus with optimal reference signal. Co-synthesis solution of stimulus and reference signal is proposed.
