Investigating Streaming Techniques and Energy Efficiency of Mobile Video Services

We report results from a measurement study of three video streaming services, YouTube, Dailymotion and Vimeo on six different smartphones. We measure and analyze the traffic and energy consumption when streaming different quality videos over Wi-Fi and 3G. We identify five different techniques to deliver the video and show that the use of a particular technique depends on the device, player, quality, and service. The energy consumption varies dramatically between devices, services, and video qualities depending on the streaming technique used. As a consequence, we come up with suggestions on how to improve the energy efficiency of mobile video streaming services.
