Multidimensional Analytic Signals and the Bedrosian Identity

The analytic signal method via the Hilbert transform is a key tool in signal analysis and processing, especially in the time-frquency analysis. Imaging and other applications to multidimensional signals call for extension of the method to higher dimensions. We justify the usage of partial Hilbert transforms to define multidimensional analytic signals from both engineering and mathematical perspectives. The important associated Bedrosian identity $T(fg)=fTg$ for partial Hilbert transforms $T$ are then studied. Characterizations and several necessity theorems are established. We also make use of the identity to construct basis functions for the time-frequency analysis.
