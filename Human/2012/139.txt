Error-Trellis Construction for Tailbiting Convolutional Codes

In this paper, we present an error-trellis construction for tailbiting convolutional codes. A tailbiting error-trellis is characterized by the condition that the syndrome former starts and ends in the same state. We clarify the correspondence between code subtrellises in the tailbiting code-trellis and error subtrellises in the tailbiting error-trellis. Also, we present a construction of tailbiting backward error-trellises. Moreover, we obtain the scalar parity-check matrix for a tailbiting convolutional code. The proposed construction is based on the adjoint-obvious realization of a syndrome former and its behavior is fully used in the discussion.
