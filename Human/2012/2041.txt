Effective M-learning design Strategies for computer science and Engineering courses

Mobile learning (M-learning) is receiving more attention as a method of delivering to learners study materials anytime and anywhere. It is a necessity for educators to come up with a layout for learning that can be accessed through mobile devices. These learning materials should consist of good quality learning theories and accurate instructional layout in order to maintain the learning as effective as possible. It is important to follow certain strategies that can help the developers for M-learning applications. In this paper we proposed a set of strategies that are useful for creating mobile prototype for Computer Science and Engineering courses or M-learning application for course content.
