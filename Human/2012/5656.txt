An Extended Cencov-Campbell Characterization of Conditional Information Geometry

We formulate and prove an axiomatic characterization of conditional information geometry, for both the normalized and the nonnormalized cases. This characterization extends the axiomatic derivation of the Fisher geometry by Cencov and Campbell to the cone of positive conditional models, and as a special case to the manifold of conditional distributions. Due to the close connection between the conditional I-divergence and the product Fisher information metric the characterization provides a new axiomatic interpretation of the primal problems underlying logistic regression and AdaBoost.
