Optimization of Survivability Analysis for Large-Scale Engineering Networks

Engineering networks fall into the category of large-scale networks with heterogeneous nodes such as sources and sinks. The survivability analysis of such networks requires the analysis of the connectivity of the network components for every possible combination of faults to determine a network response to each combination of faults. From the computational complexity point of view, the problem belongs to the class of exponential time problems at least. Partially, the problem complexity can be reduced by mapping the initial topology of a complex large-scale network with multiple sources and multiple sinks onto a set of smaller sub-topologies with multiple sources and a single sink connected to the network of sources by a single link. In this paper, the mapping procedure is applied to the Florida power grid.
