Multilevel Polarization of Polar Codes Over Arbitrary Discrete Memoryless Channels

It is shown that polar codes achieve the symmetric capacity of discrete memoryless channels with arbitrary input alphabet sizes. It is shown that in general, channel polarization happens in several, rather than only two levels so that the synthesized channels are either useless, perfect or "partially perfect". Any subset of the channel input alphabet which is closed under addition, induces a coset partition of the alphabet through its shifts. For any such partition of the input alphabet, there exists a corresponding partially perfect channel whose outputs uniquely determine the coset to which the channel input belongs. By a slight modification of the encoding and decoding rules, it is shown that perfect transmission of certain information symbols over partially perfect channels is possible. Our result is general regarding both the cardinality and the algebraic structure of the channel input alphabet; i.e we show that for any channel input alphabet size and any Abelian group structure on the alphabet, polar codes are optimal. It is also shown through an example that polar codes when considered as group/coset codes, do not achieve the capacity achievable using coset codes over arbitrary channels.
