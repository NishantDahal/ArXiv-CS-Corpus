Fault-Tolerant Spanners for Doubling Metrics: Better and Simpler

In STOC'95 Arya et al. (1995) conjectured that for any constant dimensional $n$-point Euclidean space, a $(1+\eps)$-spanner with constant degree, hop-diameter $O(\log n)$ and weight $O(\log n) \cdot ω(MST)$ can be built in $O(n \log n)$ time. Recently Elkin and Solomon (technical report, April 2012) proved this conjecture of Arya et al. in the affirmative. In fact, the proof of Elkin and Solomon is more general in two ways. First, it applies to arbitrary doubling metrics. Second, it provides a complete tradeoff between the three involved parameters that is tight (up to constant factors) in the entire range.
  Subsequently, Chan et al. (technical report, July 2012) provided another proof for Arya et al.'s conjecture, which is simpler than the proof of Elkin and Solomon. Moreover, Chan et al. (2012) also showed that one can build a fault-tolerant (FT) spanner with similar properties. Specifically, they showed that there exists a $k$-FT $(1+\eps)$-spanner with degree $O(k^2)$, hop-diameter $O(\log n)$ and weight $O(k^3 \cdot \log n) \cdot ω(MST)$. The running time of the construction of Chan et al. was not analyzed.
  In this work we improve the results of Chan et al., using a simpler proof. Specifically, we present a simple proof which shows that a $k$-FT $(1+\eps)$-spanner with degree $O(k^2)$, hop-diameter $O(\log n)$ and weight $O(k^2 \cdot \log n) \cdot ω(MST)$ can be built in $O(n \cdot (\log n + k^2))$ time. Similarly to the constructions of Elkin and Solomon and Chan et al., our construction applies to arbitrary doubling metrics. However, in contrast to the construction of Elkin and Solomon, our construction fails to provide a complete (and tight) tradeoff between the three involved parameters. The construction of Chan et al. has this drawback too.
  For random point sets in $\mathbb R^d$, we "shave" a factor of $\log n$ from the weight bound.
