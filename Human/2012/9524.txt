An Exploration on Brain Computer Interface and Its Recent Trends

Detailed exploration on Brain Computer Interface (BCI) and its recent trends has been done in this paper. Work is being done to identify objects, images, videos and their color compositions. Efforts are on the way in understanding speech, words, emotions, feelings and moods. When humans watch the surrounding environment, visual data is processed by the brain, and it is possible to reconstruct the same on the screen with some appreciable accuracy by analyzing the physiological data. This data is acquired by using one of the non-invasive techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) in BCI. The acquired signal is to be translated to produce the image on to the screen. This paper also lays suitable directions for future work.
