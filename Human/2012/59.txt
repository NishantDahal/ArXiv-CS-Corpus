Functional Programming and Security

This paper analyses the security contribution of typical functional-language features by examining them in the light of accepted information security principles. Imperative and functional code are compared to illustrate various cases. In conclusion, there may be an excellent case for the use of functional languages on the grounds of better security; however, empirical research should be done to validate this possibility.
