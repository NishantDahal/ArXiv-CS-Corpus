Game Theoretical Modelling for Dynamic Spectrum Access in TV Whitespace

In order to assess TV whitespace access scenarios, three oligopoly game models are considered and reformulated in terms of radio access: Cournot, Stackelberg, and Bertrand. Besides revisiting the relevance of Nash and Pareto equilibria, a new equilibrium concept, the joint Nash-Pareto equilibrium, is considered. An evolutionary game equilibria detection method is used. The analysis of the simulation results brings relevant insights on the issue of autonomy vs. regulation in emerging cognitive radio environments.
