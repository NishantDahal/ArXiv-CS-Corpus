Overview of MC CDMA PAPR Reduction Techniques

High Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted signal is a critical problem in multicarrier modulation systems (MCM) such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC CDMA) systems, due to large number of subcarriers. High PAPR leads to reduced resolution, and battery life. It also deteriorates system performance. This paper focuses on review of different PAPR reduction techniques with attendant technical issues as well as criteria for selection of PAPR reduction technique. To reduce PAPR the constraints are low power consumption, and low Bit Error Rate (BER). Spectral bandwidth is improved by better spectral characteristics, and low complexity/cost.
