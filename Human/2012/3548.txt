Statistical inference on the h-index with an application to top-scientist performance

Despite the huge amount of literature on h-index, few papers have been devoted to the statistical analysis of h-index when a probabilistic distribution is assumed for citation counts. The present contribution relies on showing the available inferential techniques, by providing the details for proper point and set estimation of the theoretical h-index. Moreover, some issues on simultaneous inference - aimed to produce suitable scholar comparisons - are carried out. Finally, the analysis of the citation dataset for the Nobel Laureates (in the last five years) and for the Fields medallists (from 2002 onward) is proposed.
