Applications of Quantified Constraint Solving over the Reals - Bibliography

Quantified constraints over the reals appear in numerous contexts. Usually existential quantification occurs when some parameter can be chosen by the user of a system, and univeral quantification when the exact value of a parameter is either unknown, or when it occurs in infinitely many, similar versions.
The following is a list of application areas and publications that contain applications for solving quantified constraints over the reals. The list is certainly not complete, but grows as the author encounters new items. Contributions are very welcome!
