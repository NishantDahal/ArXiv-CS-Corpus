Algebraic on Magic Square of Odd Order n

This paper aims to address the relation between a magic square of odd order $n$ and a group, and their properties. By the modulo number $n$, we construct entries for each table from initial table of magic square with large number $n^2$. Generalization of the underlying idea is presented, we obtain unique group, and we also prove variants of the main results for magic cubes.
