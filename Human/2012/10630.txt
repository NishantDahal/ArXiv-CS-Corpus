Comparison of Fuzzy and Neuro Fuzzy Image Fusion Techniques and its Applications

Image fusion is the process of integrating multiple images of the same scene into a single fused image to reduce uncertainty and minimizing redundancy while extracting all the useful information from the source images. Image fusion process is required for different applications like medical imaging, remote sensing, medical imaging, machine vision, biometrics and military applications where quality and critical information is required. In this paper, image fusion using fuzzy and neuro fuzzy logic approaches utilized to fuse images from different sensors, in order to enhance visualization. The proposed work further explores comparison between fuzzy based image fusion and neuro fuzzy fusion technique along with quality evaluation indices for image fusion like image quality index, mutual information measure, fusion factor, fusion symmetry, fusion index, root mean square error, peak signal to noise ratio, entropy, correlation coefficient and spatial frequency. Experimental results obtained from fusion process prove that the use of the neuro fuzzy based image fusion approach shows better performance in first two test cases while in the third test case fuzzy based image fusion technique gives better results.
