The Effect of Electrode Size on Memristor Properties: An Experimental and Theoretical Study

The width of the electrodes is not included in the current phenomenological models of memristance, but is included in the memory-conservation (mem-con) theory of memristance. An experimental study of the effect of changing the top electrode width was performed on titanium dioxide sol-gel memristors. It was demonstrated that both the on resistance, Ron, and the off resistance, Roff, decreased with increasing electrode size. The memory function part of the mem-con model could fit the relationship between Ron and electrode size. Similarly, the conservation function fits the change in Roff. The experimentally measured hysteresis did not fit the phenomenological model's predictions. Instead the size of the hysteresis increased with increasing electrode size, and correlated well to decreasing Ron.
