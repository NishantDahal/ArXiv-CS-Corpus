Almost periodic functions, constructively

The almost periodic functions form a natural example of a non-separable normed space. As such, it has been a challenge for constructive mathematicians to find a natural treatment of them. Here we present a simple proof of Bohr's fundamental theorem for almost periodic functions which we then generalize to almost periodic functions on general topological groups.
