A Basic Introduction on Math-Link in Mathematica

Starting from the basic ideas of mathematica, we give a detailed description about the way of linking of external programs with mathematica through proper mathlink commands. This article may be quite helpful for the beginners to start with and write programs in mathematica.
  In the first part, we illustrate how to use a mathemtica notebook and write a complete program in the notebook. Following with this, we also mention elaborately about the utility of the local and global variables those are very essential for writing a program in mathematica. All the commands needed for doing different mathematical operations can be found with some proper examples in the mathematica book written by Stephen Wolfram \cite{wolfram}.
  In the rest of this article, we concentrate our study on the most significant issue which is the process of linking of {\em external programs} with mathematica, so-called the mathlink operation. By using proper mathlink commands one can run very tedious jobs efficiently and the operations become extremely fast.
