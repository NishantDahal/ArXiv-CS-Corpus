On the Topological Complexity of Infinitary Rational Relations

We prove in this paper that there exists some infinitary rational relations which are analytic but non Borel sets, giving an answer to a question of Simonnet [Automates et Théorie Descriptive, Ph. D. Thesis, Université Paris 7, March 1992].
