It Ain't What You View, But The Way That You View It: documenting spreadsheets with Excelsior, semantic wikis, and literate programming

I describe preliminary experiments in documenting Excelsior versions of spreadsheets using semantic wikis and literate programming. The objective is to create well-structured and comprehensive documentation, easy to use by those unfamiliar with the spreadsheets documented. I discuss why so much documentation is hard to use, and briefly explain semantic wikis and literate programming; although parts of the paper are Excelsior-specific, these sections may be of more general interest.
