Parallel Evaluation of Mathematica Programs in Remote Computers Available in Network

Mathematica is a powerful application package for doing mathematics and is used almost in all branches of science. It has widespread applications ranging from quantum computation, statistical analysis, number theory, zoology, astronomy, and many more. Mathematica gives a rich set of programming extensions to its end-user language, and it permits us to write programs in procedural, functional, or logic (rule-based) style, or a mixture of all three. For tasks requiring interfaces to the external environment, mathematica provides mathlink, which allows us to communicate mathematica programs with external programs written in C, C++, F77, F90, F95, Java, or other languages. It has also extensive capabilities for editing graphics, equations, text, etc.
  In this article, we explore the basic mechanisms of parallelization of a mathematica program by sharing different parts of the program into all other computers available in the network. Doing the parallelization, we can perform large computational operations within a very short period of time, and therefore, the efficiency of the numerical works can be achieved. Parallel computation supports any version of mathematica and it also works as well even if different versions of mathematica are installed in different computers. The whole operation can run under any supported operating system like Unix, Windows, Macintosh, etc. Here we focus our study only for the Unix based operating system, but this method works as well for all other cases.
