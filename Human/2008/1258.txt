Searching for Frequent Colors in Rectangles

We study a new variant of colored orthogonal range searching problem: given a query rectangle $Q$ all colors $c$, such that at least a fraction $Ï„$ of all points in $Q$ are of color $c$, must be reported. We describe several data structures for that problem that use pseudo-linear space and answer queries in poly-logarithmic time.
