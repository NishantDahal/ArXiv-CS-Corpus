On the statistical physics of directed polymers in a random medium and their relation to tree codes

Using well-known results from statistical physics, concerning the almost-sure behavior of the free energy of directed polymers in a random medium, we prove that random tree codes achieve the distortion-rate function almost surely under a certain symmetry condition.
