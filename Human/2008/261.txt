Separating NOF communication complexity classes RP and NP

We provide a non-explicit separation of the number-on-forehead communication complexity classes RP and NP when the number of players is up to δlog(n) for any δ<1. Recent lower bounds on Set-Disjointness [LS08,CA08] provide an explicit separation between these classes when the number of players is only up to o(loglog(n)).
