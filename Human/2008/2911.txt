Multi-Objective Model Checking of Markov Decision Processes

We study and provide efficient algorithms for multi-objective model checking problems for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Given an MDP, M, and given multiple linear-time (ω-regular or LTL) properties \varphi\_i, and probabilities r\_i ε[0,1], i=1,...,k, we ask whether there exists a strategy σfor the controller such that, for all i, the probability that a trajectory of M controlled by σsatisfies \varphi\_i is at least r\_i. We provide an algorithm that decides whether there exists such a strategy and if so produces it, and which runs in time polynomial in the size of the MDP. Such a strategy may require the use of both randomization and memory. We also consider more general multi-objective ω-regular queries, which we motivate with an application to assume-guarantee compositional reasoning for probabilistic systems.
  Note that there can be trade-offs between different properties: satisfying property \varphi\_1 with high probability may necessitate satisfying \varphi\_2 with low probability. Viewing this as a multi-objective optimization problem, we want information about the "trade-off curve" or Pareto curve for maximizing the probabilities of different properties. We show that one can compute an approximate Pareto curve with respect to a set of ω-regular properties in time polynomial in the size of the MDP.
  Our quantitative upper bounds use LP methods. We also study qualitative multi-objective model checking problems, and we show that these can be analysed by purely graph-theoretic methods, even though the strategies may still require both randomization and memory.
