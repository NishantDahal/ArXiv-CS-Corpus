Using a computer algebra system to simplify expressions for Titchmarsh-Weyl m-functions associated with the Hydrogen Atom on the half line

In this paper we give simplified formulas for certain polynomials which arise in some new Titchmarsh-Weyl m-functions for the radial part of the separated Hydrogen atom on the half line and two independent programs for generating them using the symbolic manipulator Mathematica.
