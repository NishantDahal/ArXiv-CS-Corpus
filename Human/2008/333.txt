Lamination And Microstructuring Technology for a Bio-Cell Multiwell array

Microtechnology becomes a versatile tool for biological and biomedical applications. Microwells have been established long but remained non-intelligent up to now. Merging new fabrication techniques and handling concepts with microelectronics enables to realize intelligent microwells suitable for future improved cancer treatment. The described technology depicts the basis for the fabrication of a elecronically enhanced microwell. Thin aluminium sheets are structured by laser micro machining and laminated successively to obtain registration tolerances of the respective layers of 5..10Â$μ$m. The microwells lasermachined into the laminate are with 50..80Â$μ$m diameter, allowing to hold individual cells within the well. The individual process steps are described and results on the microstructuring are given.
