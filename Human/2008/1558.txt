Scaling of critical connectivity of mobile ad hoc communication networks

In this paper, critical global connectivity of mobile ad hoc communication networks (MAHCN) is investigated. We model the two-dimensional plane on which nodes move randomly with a triangular lattice. Demanding the best communication of the network, we account the global connectivity $η$ as a function of occupancy $σ$ of sites in the lattice by mobile nodes. Critical phenomena of the connectivity for different transmission ranges $r$ are revealed by numerical simulations, and these results fit well to the analysis based on the assumption of homogeneous mixing . Scaling behavior of the connectivity is found as $η\sim f(R^βσ)$, where $R=(r-r_{0})/r_{0}$, $r_{0}$ is the length unit of the triangular lattice and $β$ is the scaling index in the universal function $f(x)$. The model serves as a sort of site percolation on dynamic complex networks relative to geometric distance. Moreover, near each critical $σ_c(r)$ corresponding to certain transmission range $r$, there exists a cut-off degree $k_c$ below which the clustering coefficient of such self-organized networks keeps a constant while the averaged nearest neighbor degree exhibits a unique linear variation with the degree k, which may be useful to the designation of real MAHCN.
