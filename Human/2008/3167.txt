Critique du rapport signal à bruit en communications numériques -- Questioning the signal to noise ratio in digital communications

The signal to noise ratio, which plays such an important rôle in information theory, is shown to become pointless for digital communications where the demodulation is achieved via new fast estimation techniques. Operational calculus, differential algebra, noncommutative algebra and nonstandard analysis are the main mathematical tools.
