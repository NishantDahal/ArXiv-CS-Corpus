Liouvillian Solutions of Difference-Differential Equations

For a field k$with an automorphism σand a derivation δ, we introduce the notion of liouvillian solutions of linear difference-differential systems {σ(Y) = AY, δ(Y) = BY} over k and characterize the existence of liouvillian solutions in terms of the Galois group of the systems. We will give an algorithm to decide whether such a system has liouvillian solutions when k = C(x,t), σ(x) = x+1, δ= d/dt$ and the size of the system is a prime.
