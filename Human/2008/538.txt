New Perspectives and some Celebrated Quantum Inequalities

Some of the important inequalities associated with quantum entropy are immediate algebraic consequences of the Hansen-Pedersen-Jensen inequality. A general argument is given in terms of the matrix perspective of an operator convex function. A matrix analogue of Mar√©chal's extended perspectives provides additional inequalities, including a $p+q\leq 1$ result of Lieb.
