Asymptotic Bound on Binary Self-Orthogonal Codes

We present two constructions for binary self-orthogonal codes. It turns out that our constructions yield a constructive bound on binary self-orthogonal codes. In particular, when the information rate R=1/2, by our constructive lower bound, the relative minimum distance δ\approx 0.0595 (for GV bound, δ\approx 0.110). Moreover, we have proved that the binary self-orthogonal codes asymptotically achieve the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.
