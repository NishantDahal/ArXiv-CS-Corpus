Hot Roller Embossing for the Creation of Microfluidic Devices

We report on the hot roller embossing of polymer sheets for the creation of microfluidic structures. Measurements conducted on 100 $μ$m features showed that the lateral dimensions could be replicated to within 2% tolerance, while over 85% of mould depth was embossed. Feature sizes down to 50 $μ$m and feature depths up to 30 $μ$m had been achieved. At lower temperatures, asymmetric pile up of polymer material outside embossed regions was observed with higher pile up occurring on the trailing side of the embossed regions.
