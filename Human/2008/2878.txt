On the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for Frequency Correlation Matrices of Doubly Selective Fading Channels for OFDM Systems

The analytic expression of CRLB and the maximum likelihood estimator for the sample frequency correlation matrices in doubly selective fading channels for OFDM systems are reported in this paper. According to the analytical and numerical results, the amount of samples affects the average mean square error dominantly while the SNR and the Doppler spread do negligibly.
