An unbreakable cryptosystem

The remarkably long-standing problem of cryptography is to generate completely secure key. It is widely believed that the task cannot be achieved within classical cryptography. However, there is no proof in support of this belief. We present an incredibly simple classical cryptosystem which can generate completely secure key.
