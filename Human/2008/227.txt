Instant Computing - A New Computation Paradigm

Voltage peaks on a conventional computer's power lines allow for the well-known dangerous DPA attacks. We show that measurement of a quantum computer's transient state during a computational step reveals information about a complete computation of arbitrary length, which can be extracted by repeated probing, if the computer is suitably programmed. Instant computing, as we name this mode of operation, recognizes for any total or partial recursive function arguments lying in the domain of definition and yields their function value with arbitrary small error probability in probabilistic linear time. This implies recognition of (not necessarily recursively enumerable) complements of recursively enumerable sets and the solution of the halting problem. Future quantum computers are shown to be likely to allow for instant computing, and some consequences are pointed out.
