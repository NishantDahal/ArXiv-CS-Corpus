How to Run Mathematica Batch-files in Background ?

Mathematica is a versatile equipment for doing numeric and symbolic computations and it has wide spread applications in all branches of science. Mathematica has a complete consistency to design it at every stage that gives it multilevel capability and helps advanced usage evolve naturally. Mathematica functions work for any precision of number and it can be easily computed with symbols, represented graphically to get the best answer. Mathematica is a robust software development that can be used in any popular operating systems and it can be communicated with external programs by using proper mathlink commands.
  Sometimes it is quite desirable to run jobs in background of a computer which can take considerable amount of time to finish, and this allows us to do work on other tasks, while keeping the jobs running. Most of us are very familiar to run jobs in background for the programs written in the languages like C, C++, F77, F90, F95, etc. But the way of running jobs, written in a mathematica notebook, in background is quite different from the conventional method. In this article, we explore how to create a mathematica batch-file from a mathematica notebook and run it in background. Here we concentrate our study only for the Unix version, but one can run mathematica programs in background for the Windows version as well by using proper mathematica batch-file.
