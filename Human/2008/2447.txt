Abstract numeration systems on bounded languages and multiplication by a constant

A set of integers is $S$-recognizable in an abstract numeration system $S$ if the language made up of the representations of its elements is accepted by a finite automaton. For abstract numeration systems built over bounded languages with at least three letters, we show that multiplication by an integer $λ\ge2$ does not preserve $S$-recognizability, meaning that there always exists a $S$-recognizable set $X$ such that $λX$ is not $S$-recognizable. The main tool is a bijection between the representation of an integer over a bounded language and its decomposition as a sum of binomial coefficients with certain properties, the so-called combinatorial numeration system.
