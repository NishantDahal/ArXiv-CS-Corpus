The Choquet integral for the aggregation of interval scales in multicriteria decision making

This paper addresses the question of which models fit with information concerning the preferences of the decision maker over each attribute, and his preferences about aggregation of criteria (interacting criteria). We show that the conditions induced by these information plus some intuitive conditions lead to a unique possible aggregation operator: the Choquet integral.
