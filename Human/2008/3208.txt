Convergence of Min-Sum Message Passing for Quadratic Optimization

We establish the convergence of the min-sum message passing algorithm for minimization of a broad class of quadratic objective functions: those that admit a convex decomposition. Our results also apply to the equivalent problem of the convergence of Gaussian belief propagation.
