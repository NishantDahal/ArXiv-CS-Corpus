In the beginning was game semantics

This article presents an overview of computability logic -- the game-semantically constructed logic of interactive computational tasks and resources. There is only one non-overview, technical section in it, devoted to a proof of the soundness of affine logic with respect to the semantics of computability logic. A comprehensive online source on the subject can be found at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html
