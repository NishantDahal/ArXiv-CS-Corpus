Attempto Controlled English (ACE)

Attempto Controlled English (ACE) allows domain specialists to interactively formulate requirements specifications in domain concepts. ACE can be accurately and efficiently processed by a computer, but is expressive enough to allow natural usage. The Attempto system translates specification texts in ACE into discourse representation structures and optionally into Prolog. Translated specification texts are incrementally added to a knowledge base. This knowledge base can be queried in ACE for verification, and it can be executed for simulation, prototyping and validation of the specification.
