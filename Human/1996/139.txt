GramCheck: A Grammar and Style Checker

This paper presents a grammar and style checker demonstrator for Spanish and Greek native writers developed within the project GramCheck. Besides a brief grammar error typology for Spanish, a linguistically motivated approach to detection and diagnosis is presented, based on the generalized use of PROLOG extensions to highly typed unification-based grammars. The demonstrator, currently including full coverage for agreement errors and certain head-argument relation issues, also provides correction by means of an analysis-transfer-synthesis cycle. Finally, future extensions to the current system are discussed.
