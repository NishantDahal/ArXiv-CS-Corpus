Restricted Parallelism in Object-Oriented Lexical Parsing

We present an approach to parallel natural language parsing which is based on a concurrent, object-oriented model of computation. A depth-first, yet incomplete parsing algorithm for a dependency grammar is specified and several restrictions on the degree of its parallelization are discussed.
