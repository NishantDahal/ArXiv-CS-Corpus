Incremental Centering and Center Ambiguity

In this paper, we present a model of anaphor resolution within the framework of the centering model. The consideration of an incremental processing mode introduces the need to manage structural ambiguity at the center level. Hence, the centering framework is further refined to account for local and global parsing ambiguities which propagate up to the level of center representations, yielding moderately adapted data structures for the centering algorithm.
