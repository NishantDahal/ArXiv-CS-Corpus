Integrating HMM-Based Speech Recognition With Direct Manipulation In A Multimodal Korean Natural Language Interface

This paper presents a HMM-based speech recognition engine and its integration into direct manipulation interfaces for Korean document editor. Speech recognition can reduce typical tedious and repetitive actions which are inevitable in standard GUIs (graphic user interfaces). Our system consists of general speech recognition engine called ABrain {Auditory Brain} and speech commandable document editor called SHE {Simple Hearing Editor}. ABrain is a phoneme-based speech recognition engine which shows up to 97% of discrete command recognition rate. SHE is a EuroBridge widget-based document editor that supports speech commands as well as direct manipulation interfaces.
