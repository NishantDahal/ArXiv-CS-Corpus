The discourse functions of Italian subjects: a centering approach

This paper examines the discourse functions that different types of subjects perform in Italian within the centering framework. I build on my previous work (COLING90) that accounted for the alternation of null and strong pronouns in subject position. I extend my previous analysis in several ways: for example, I refine the notion of {\sc continue} and discuss the centering functions of full NPs.
