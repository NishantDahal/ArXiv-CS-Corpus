A Corpus Study of Negative Imperatives in Natural Language Instructions

In this paper, we define the notion of a preventative expression and discuss a corpus study of such expressions in instructional text. We discuss our coding schema, which takes into account both form and function features, and present measures of inter-coder reliability for those features. We then discuss the correlations that exist between the function and the form features.
