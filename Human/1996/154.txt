Centering theory and the Italian pronominal system

In this paper, I give an account of some phenomena of pronominalization in Italian in terms of centering theory. After a general introduction to the Italian pronominal system, I will review centering, and then show how the original rules have to be extended or modified. Finally, I will show that centering does not account for two phenomena: first, the functional role of an utterance may override the predictions of centering; second, a null subject can be used to refer to a whole discourse segment.
