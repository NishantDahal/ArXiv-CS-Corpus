Efficient Algorithms for Parsing the DOP Model? A Reply to Joshua Goodman

This note is a reply to Joshua Goodman's paper "Efficient Algorithms for Parsing the DOP Model" (Goodman, 1996; cmp-lg/9604008). In his paper, Goodman makes a number of claims about (my work on) the Data-Oriented Parsing model (Bod, 1992-1996). This note shows that some of these claims must be mistaken.
