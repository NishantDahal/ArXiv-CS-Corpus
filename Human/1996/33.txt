Collocational Grammar

A perspective of statistical language models which emphasizes their collocational aspect is advocated. It is suggested that strings be generalized in terms of classes of relationships instead of classes of objects. The single most important characteristic of such a model is a mechanism for comparing patterns. When patterns are fully generalized a natural definition of syntactic class emerges as a subset of relational class. These collocational syntactic classes should be an unambiguous partition of traditional syntactic classes.
