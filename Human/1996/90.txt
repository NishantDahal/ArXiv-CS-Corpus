Stabilizing the Richardson Algorithm by Controlling Chaos

By viewing the operations of the Richardson purification algorithm as a discrete time dynamical process, we propose a method to overcome the instability of the algorithm by controlling chaos. We present theoretical analysis and numerical results on the behavior and performance of the stabilized algorithm.
