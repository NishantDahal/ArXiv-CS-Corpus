A Morphology-System and Part-of-Speech Tagger for German

This paper presents an integrated tool for German morphology and statistical part-of-speech tagging which aims at making some well established methods widely available. The software is very user friendly, runs on any PC and can be downloaded as a complete package (including lexicon and documentation) from the World Wide Web. Compared with the performance of other tagging systems the tagger produces similar results.
