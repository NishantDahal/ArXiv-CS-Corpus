Quantum Computing, NP-complete Problems and Chaotic Dynamics

An approach to the solution of NP-complete problems based on quantum computing and chaotic dynamics is proposed. We consider the satisfiability problem and argue that the problem, in principle, can be solved in polynomial time if we combine the quantum computer with the chaotic dynamics amplifier based on the logistic map. We discuss a possible implementation of such a chaotic quantum computation by using the atomic quantum computer with quantum gates described by the Hartree-Fock equations. In this case, in principle, one can build not only standard linear quantum gates but also nonlinear gates and moreover they obey to Fermi statistics. This new type of entaglement related with Fermi statistics can be interesting also for quantum communication theory.
