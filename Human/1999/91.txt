The Structure of Weighting Coefficient Matrices of Harmonic Differential Quadrature and Its Applications

The structure of weighting coefficient matrices of Harmonic Differential Quadrature (HDQ) is found to be either centrosymmetric or skew centrosymmetric depending on the order of the corresponding derivatives. The properties of both matrices are briefly discussed in this paper. It is noted that the computational effort of the harmonic quadrature for some problems can be further reduced up to 75 per cent by using the properties of the above-mentioned matrices.
