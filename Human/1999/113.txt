DRAFT : Task System and Item Architecture (TSIA)

During its execution, a task is independent of all other tasks. For an application which executes in terms of tasks, the application definition can be free of the details of the execution. Many projects have demonstrated that a task system (TS) can provide such an application with a parallel, distributed, heterogeneous, adaptive, dynamic, real-time, interactive, reliable, secure or other execution. A task consists of items and thus the application is defined in terms of items. An item architecture (IA) can support arrays, routines and other structures of items, thus allowing for a structured application definition. Taking properties from many projects, the support can extend through to currying, application defined types, conditional items, streams and other definition elements. A task system and item architecture (TSIA) thus promises unprecedented levels of support for application execution and definition.
