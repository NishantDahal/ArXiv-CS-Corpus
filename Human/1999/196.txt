Safe Deals Between Strangers

E-business, information serving, and ubiquitous computing will create heavy request traffic from strangers or even incognitos. Such requests must be managed automatically. Two ways of doing this are well known: giving every incognito consumer the same treatment, and rendering service in return for money. However, different behavior will be often wanted, e.g., for a university library with different access policies for undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, alumni, citizens of the same state, and everyone else.
  For a data or process server contacted by client machines on behalf of users not previously known, we show how to provide reliable automatic access administration conforming to service agreements. Implementations scale well from very small collections of consumers and producers to immense client/server networks. Servers can deliver information, effect state changes, and control external equipment.
  Consumer privacy is easily addressed by the same protocol. We support consumer privacy, but allow servers to deny their resources to incognitos. A protocol variant even protects against statistical attacks by consortia of service organizations.
  One e-commerce application would put the consumer's tokens on a smart card whose readers are in vending kiosks. In e-business we can simplify supply chain administration. Our method can also be used in sensitive networks without introducing new security loopholes.
