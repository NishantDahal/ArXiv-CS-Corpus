Hadamard product nonlinear formulation of Galerkin and finite element methods

A novel nonlinear formulation of the finite element and Galerkin methods is presented here, which leads to the Hadamard product expression of the resultant nonlinear algebraic analogue. The presented formulation attains the advantages of weak formulation in the standard finite element and Galerkin schemes and avoids the costly repeated numerical integration of the Jacobian matrix via the recently developed SJT product approach. This also provides possibility of the nonlinear decoupling computations.
