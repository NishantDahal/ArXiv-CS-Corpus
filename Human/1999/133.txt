Learning Transformation Rules to Find Grammatical Relations

Grammatical relationships are an important level of natural language processing. We present a trainable approach to find these relationships through transformation sequences and error-driven learning. Our approach finds grammatical relationships between core syntax groups and bypasses much of the parsing phase. On our training and test set, our procedure achieves 63.6% recall and 77.3% precision (f-score = 69.8).
