Ocular dominance patterns in mammalian visual cortex: A wire length minimization approach

We propose a theory for ocular dominance (OD) patterns in mammalian primary visual cortex. This theory is based on the premise that OD pattern is an adaptation to minimize the length of intra-cortical wiring. Thus we can understand the existing OD patterns by solving a wire length minimization problem. We divide all the neurons into two classes: left-eye dominated and right-eye dominated. We find that segregation of neurons into monocular regions reduces wire length if the number of connections with the neurons of the same class differs from that with the other class. The shape of the regions depends on the relative fraction of neurons in the two classes. If the numbers are close we find that the optimal OD pattern consists of interdigitating stripes. If one class is less numerous than the other, the optimal OD pattern consists of patches of the first class neurons in the sea of the other class neurons. We predict the transition from stripes to patches when the fraction of neurons dominated by the ipsilateral eye is about 40%. This prediction agrees with the data in macaque and Cebus monkeys. This theory can be applied to other binary cortical systems.
