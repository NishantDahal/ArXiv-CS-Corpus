Cascaded Markov Models

This paper presents a new approach to partial parsing of context-free structures. The approach is based on Markov Models. Each layer of the resulting structure is represented by its own Markov Model, and output of a lower layer is passed as input to the next higher layer. An empirical evaluation of the method yields very good results for NP/PP chunking of German newspaper texts.
