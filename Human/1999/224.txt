Semantic robust parsing for noun extraction from natural language queries

This paper describes how robust parsing techniques can be fruitful applied for building a query generation module which is part of a pipelined NLP architecture aimed at process natural language queries in a restricted domain. We want to show that semantic robustness represents a key issue in those NLP systems where it is more likely to have partial and ill-formed utterances due to various factors (e.g. noisy environments, low quality of speech recognition modules, etc...) and where it is necessary to succeed, even if partially, in extracting some meaningful information.
