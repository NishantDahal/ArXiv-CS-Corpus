Detecting Sub-Topic Correspondence through Bipartite Term Clustering

This paper addresses a novel task of detecting sub-topic correspondence in a pair of text fragments, enhancing common notions of text similarity. This task is addressed by coupling corresponding term subsets through bipartite clustering. The paper presents a cost-based clustering scheme and compares it with a bipartite version of the single-link method, providing illustrating results.
