SCR3: towards usability of formal methods

This paper gives an overview of SCR3 -- a toolset designed to increase the usability of formal methods for software development. Formal requirements are specified in SCR3 in an easy to use and review format, and then used in checking requirements for correctness and in verifying consistency between annotated code and requirements.
  In this paper we discuss motivations behind this work, describe several tools which are part of SCR3, and illustrate their operation on an example of a Cruise Control system.
