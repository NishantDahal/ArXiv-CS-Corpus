Resolution of Verb Ellipsis in Japanese Sentence using Surface Expressions and Examples

Verbs are sometimes omitted in Japanese sentences. It is necessary to recover omitted verbs for purposes of language understanding, machine translation, and conversational processing. This paper describes a practical way to recover omitted verbs by using surface expressions and examples. We experimented the resolution of verb ellipses by using this information, and obtained a recall rate of 73% and a precision rate of 66% on test sentences.
