Beyond Concern: Understanding Net Users' Attitudes About Online Privacy

People are concerned about privacy, particularly on the Internet. While many studies have provided evidence of this concern, few have explored the nature of the concern in detail, especially for the online environment. With this study, we have tried to better understand the nature of online privacy concerns; we look beyond the fact that people are concerned and attempt to understand how they are concerned. We hope our results will help inform both policy decisions as well as the development of technology tools that can assist Internet users in protecting their privacy.
  We present results here from the analysis of 381 questionnaires completed between November 6 and November 13, 1998 by American Internet users. The sample was drawn from the FamilyPC magazine/Digital Research, Inc. Family Panel. While this is not a statistically representative sample of US Internet users, our respondents are heavy Internet users, and quite possibly lead innovators. As such, we believe that this sample is important for understanding the future Internet user population.
