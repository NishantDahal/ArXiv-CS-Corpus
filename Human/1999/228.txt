Designing an interface to optimize reading with small display windows

The electronic presentation of text in small display windows is mushrooming. In the present paper, four ways of presenting text in a small display window were examined and compared to a Normal Page condition: rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP), RSVP with a Completion Meter, Sentence-by-Sentence presentation, and Sentence-by-Sentence presentation with a Completion Meter. Dependent measures were reading efficiency - speed and comprehension - and preference. For designers of hardware or software with small display windows, the results suggest the following: (1) Though RSVP is disliked by readers, the present methods of allowing self-pacing and regressions in RSVP, unlike earlier tested methods, are efficient and feasible. (2) Slower reading in RSVP should be achieved by increasing pauses between sentences or by repeating sentences, not by decreasing the within-sentence rate. (3) Completion meters do not interfere with performance, and are usually preferred. (4) The space-saving Sentence-by-Sentence format is as efficient and as preferred as the Normal Page format.
