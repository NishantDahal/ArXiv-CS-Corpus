On the parameters of Algebraic Geometry codes related to Arf semigroups

In this paper we compute the order (or Feng-Rao) bound on the minimum distance of one-point algebraic geometry codes, when the Weierstrass semigroup at the point Q is an Arf semigroup. The results developed to that purpose also provide the dimension of the improved geometric Goppa codes related to those.
