Rational points, genus and asymptotic behaviour in reduced algebraic curves over finite fields

The number A(q) shows the asymptotic behaviour of the quotient of the number of rational points over the genus of non-singular absolutely irreducible curves over a finite field Fq. Research on bounds for A(q) is closely connected with the so-called asymptotic main problem in Coding Theory. In this paper, we study some generalizations of this number for non-irreducible curves, their connection with A(q) and its application in Coding Theory.
