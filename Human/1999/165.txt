Further Results on Arithmetic Filters for Geometric Predicates

An efficient technique to solve precision problems consists in using exact computations. For geometric predicates, using systematically expensive exact computations can be avoided by the use of filters. The predicate is first evaluated using rounding computations, and an error estimation gives a certificate of the validity of the result. In this note, we studies the statistical efficiency of filters for cosphericity predicate with an assumption of regular distribution of the points. We prove that the expected value of the polynomial corresponding to the in sphere test is greater than epsilon with probability O(epsilon log 1/epsilon) improving the results of a previous paper by the same authors.
