An Introduction to Query Order

Hemaspaandra, Hempel, and Wechsung [cs.CC/9909020] raised the following questions: If one is allowed one question to each of two different information sources, does the order in which one asks the questions affect the class of problems that one can solve with the given access? If so, which order yields the greater computational power?
  The answers to these questions have been learned-inasfar as they can be learned without resolving whether or not the polynomial hierarchy collapses-for both the polynomial hierarchy and the boolean hierarchy. In the polynomial hierarchy, query order never matters. In the boolean hierarchy, query order sometimes does not matter and, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, sometimes does matter. Furthermore, the study of query order has yielded dividends in seemingly unrelated areas, such as bottleneck computations and downward translation of equality.
  In this article, we present some of the central results on query order. The article is written in such a way as to encourage the reader to try his or her own hand at proving some of these results. We also give literature pointers to the quickly growing set of related results and applications.
