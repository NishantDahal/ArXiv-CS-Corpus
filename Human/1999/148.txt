Algorithmic Complexity in Minority Game

In this paper we introduce a new approach for the study of the complex behavior of Minority Game using the tools of algorithmic complexity, physical entropy and information theory. We show that physical complexity and mutual information function strongly depend on memory size of the agents and yields more information about the complex features of the stream of binary outcomes of the game than volatility itself.
