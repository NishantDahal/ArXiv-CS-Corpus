MyLibrary: A Model for Implementing a User-centered, Customizable Interface to a Library's Collection of Information Resources

The paper describes an extensible model for implementing a user-centered, customizable interface to a library's collection of information resources. This model, called MyLibrary, integrates the principles of librarianship (collection, organization, dissemination, and evaluation) with globally networked computing resources creating a dynamic, customer-driven front-end to any library's set of materials. The model supports a framework for libraries to provide enhanced access to local and remote sets of data, information, and knowledge. At the same, the model does not overwhelm its users with too much information because the users control exactly how much information is displayed to them at any given time. The model is active and not passive; direct human interaction, computer mediated guidance and communication technologies, as well as current awareness services all play indispensable roles in this system.
