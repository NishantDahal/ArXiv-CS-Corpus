Universal Object Oriented Languages and Computer Algebra

The universal object oriented languages made programming more simple and efficient. In the article is considered possibilities of using similar methods in computer algebra. A clear and powerful universal language is useful if particular problem was not implemented in standard software packages like REDUCE, MATHEMATICA, etc. and if the using of internal programming languages of the packages looks not very efficient.
 Functional languages like LISP had some advantages and traditions for algebraic and symbolic manipulations. Functional and object oriented programming are not incompatible ones. An extension of the model of an object for manipulation with pure functions and algebraic expressions is considered.
