WebScript -- A Scripting Language for the Web

WebScript is a scripting language for processing Web documents. Designed as an extension to Jacl, the Java implementation of Tcl, WebScript allows programmers to manipulate HTML in the same way as Tcl manipulates text strings and GUI elements. This leads to a completely new way of writing the next generation of Web applications. This paper presents the motivation behind the design and implementation of WebScript, an overview of its major features, as well as some demonstrations of its power.
