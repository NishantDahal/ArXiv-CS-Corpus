A Differential Invariant for Zooming

This paper presents an invariant under scaling and linear brightness change. The invariant is based on differentials and therefore is a local feature. Rotationally invariant 2-d differential Gaussian operators up to third order are proposed for the implementation of the invariant. The performance is analyzed by simulating a camera zoom-out.
