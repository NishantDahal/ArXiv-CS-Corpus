The Impact of Net Culture on Mainstream Societies: a Global Analysis

In this work the impact of the Internet culture on standard mainstream societies has been analyzed. After analytically establishing the fact that the Net can be viewed as a pan-societal superstructure which supports its own distinct culture, an ethnographic analysis is provided to find out the key aspects of this culture. The elements of this culture which have an empowering impacts on the standard mainstream societies, as well as the elements in it which can cause discouraging social effects are then discussed by a global investigation of the present status of various fundamental aspects (e,g, education, economics, politics, entertainment etc) of the mainstream societies as well as their links with the Net culture. Though immensely potential for providing various prominent positive impacts, the key findings of this work indicate that misuse of Internet can create tremendous harm to the members of the mainstream societies by generating a set of morally crippled people as well as a future generation completely void of principles and ethics. This structured diagnostic approach to the social problems caused by the manhandling of Internet leads to a concrete effort of providing the measures that can be taken to enhance or to overcome the supporting and limiting effects of the Net culture respectively with the intent to benefit our society and to protect the teratoidation of certain ethical values.
