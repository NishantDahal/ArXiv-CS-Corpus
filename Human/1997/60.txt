Grammatical analysis in the OVIS spoken-dialogue system

We argue that grammatical processing is a viable alternative to concept spotting for processing spoken input in a practical dialogue system. We discuss the structure of the grammar, the properties of the parser, and a method for achieving robustness. We discuss test results suggesting that grammatical processing allows fast and accurate processing of spoken input.
