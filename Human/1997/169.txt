Topic Graph Generation for Query Navigation: Use of Frequency Classes for Topic Extraction

To make an interactive guidance mechanism for document retrieval systems, we developed a user-interface which presents users the visualized map of topics at each stage of retrieval process. Topic words are automatically extracted by frequency analysis and the strength of the relationships between topic words is measured by their co-occurrence. A major factor affecting a user's impression of a given topic word graph is the balance between common topic words and specific topic words. By using frequency classes for topic word extraction, we made it possible to select well-balanced set of topic words, and to adjust the balance of common and specific topic words.
