Recognizing Referential Links: An Information Extraction Perspective

We present an efficient and robust reference resolution algorithm in an end-to-end state-of-the-art information extraction system, which must work with a considerably impoverished syntactic analysis of the input sentences. Considering this disadvantage, the basic setup to collect, filter, then order by salience does remarkably well with third-person pronouns, but needs more semantic and discourse information to improve the treatments of other expression types.
