Tailored Patient Information: Some Issues and Questions

Tailored patient information (TPI) systems are computer programs which produce personalised heath-information material for patients. TPI systems are of growing interest to the natural-language generation (NLG) community; many TPI systems have also been developed in the medical community, usually with mail-merge technology. No matter what technology is used, experience shows that it is not easy to field a TPI system, even if it is shown to be effective in clinical trials. In this paper we discuss some of the difficulties in fielding TPI systems. This is based on our experiences with 2 TPI systems, one for generating asthma-information booklets and one for generating smoking-cessation letters.
