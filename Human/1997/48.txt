Sense Tagging: Semantic Tagging with a Lexicon

Sense tagging, the automatic assignment of the appropriate sense from some lexicon to each of the words in a text, is a specialised instance of the general problem of semantic tagging by category or type. We discuss which recent word sense disambiguation algorithms are appropriate for sense tagging. It is our belief that sense tagging can be carried out effectively by combining several simple, independent, methods and we include the design of such a tagger. A prototype of this system has been implemented, correctly tagging 86% of polysemous word tokens in a small test set, providing evidence that our hypothesis is correct.
