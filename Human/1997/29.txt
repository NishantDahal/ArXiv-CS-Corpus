Concept Clustering and Knowledge Integration from a Children's Dictionary

Knowledge structures called Concept Clustering Knowledge Graphs (CCKGs) are introduced along with a process for their construction from a machine readable dictionary. CCKGs contain multiple concepts interrelated through multiple semantic relations together forming a semantic cluster represented by a conceptual graph. The knowledge acquisition is performed on a children's first dictionary. A collection of conceptual clusters together can form the basis of a lexical knowledge base, where each CCKG contains a limited number of highly connected words giving useful information about a particular domain or situation.
