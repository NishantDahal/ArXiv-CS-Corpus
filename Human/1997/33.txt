Emphatic generation: employing the theory of semantic emphasis for text generation

The paper deals with the problem of text generation and planning approaches making only limited formally specifiable contact with accounts of grammar. We propose an enhancement of a systemically-based generation architecture for German (the KOMET system) by aspects of Kunze's theory of semantic emphasis. Doing this, we gain more control over both concept selection in generation and choice of fine-grained grammatical variation.
