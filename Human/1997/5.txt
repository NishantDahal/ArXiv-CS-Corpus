Toric Generalized Characteristic Polynomials

We illustrate an efficient new method for handling polynomial systems with degenerate solution sets. In particular, a corollary of our techniques is a new algorithm to find an isolated point in every excess component of the zero set (over an algebraically closed field) of any $n$ by $n$ system of polynomial equations. Since we use the sparse resultant, we thus obtain complexity bounds (for converting any input polynomial system into a multilinear factorization problem) which are close to cubic in the degree of the underlying variety -- significantly better than previous bounds which were pseudo-polynomial in the classical BÃ©zout bound. By carefully taking into account the underlying toric geometry, we are also able to improve the reliability of certain sparse resultant based algorithms for polynomial system solving.
