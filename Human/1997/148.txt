Use of Weighted Finite State Transducers in Part of Speech Tagging

This paper addresses issues in part of speech disambiguation using finite-state transducers and presents two main contributions to the field. One of them is the use of finite-state machines for part of speech tagging. Linguistic and statistical information is represented in terms of weights on transitions in weighted finite-state transducers. Another contribution is the successful combination of techniques -- linguistic and statistical -- for word disambiguation, compounded with the notion of word classes.
