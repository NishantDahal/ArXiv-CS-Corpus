Sloppy Identity

Although sloppy interpretation is usually accounted for by theories of ellipsis, it often arises in non-elliptical contexts. In this paper, a theory of sloppy interpretation is provided which captures this fact. The underlying idea is that sloppy interpretation results from a semantic constraint on parallel structures and the theory is shown to predict sloppy readings for deaccented and paycheck sentences as well as relational-, event-, and one-anaphora. It is further shown to capture the interaction of sloppy/strict ambiguity with quantification and binding.
