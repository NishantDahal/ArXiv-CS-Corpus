OSCMAC_Duty_Cycle_with_Multi_Helpers_CT_Mode_WILEM_Technology_in_Wireless_Sensor_Networks

Recently, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) grow to be one of the dominant technology trends; new needs are continuously emerging and demanding more complex constraints in a duty cycle, such as extend the life time communication . The MAC layer plays a crucial role in these networks; it controls the communication module and manages the medium sharing. In this work we use OSC-MAC tackles combining with the performance of cooperative transmission (CT) in multi-hop WSN and the Wi-Lem technology
