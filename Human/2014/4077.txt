Approximation Schemes for Partitioning: Convex Decomposition and Surface Approximation

We revisit two NP-hard geometric partitioning problems - convex decomposition and surface approximation. Building on recent developments in geometric separators, we present quasi-polynomial time algorithms for these problems with improved approximation guarantees.
