Sentiment Analysis Using Collaborated Opinion Mining

Opinion mining and Sentiment analysis have emerged as a field of study since the widespread of World Wide Web and internet. Opinion refers to extraction of those lines or phrase in the raw and huge data which express an opinion. Sentiment analysis on the other hand identifies the polarity of the opinion being extracted. In this paper we propose the sentiment analysis in collaboration with opinion extraction, summarization, and tracking the records of the students. The paper modifies the existing algorithm in order to obtain the collaborated opinion about the students. The resultant opinion is represented as very high, high, moderate, low and very low. The paper is based on a case study where teachers give their remarks about the students and by applying the proposed sentiment analysis algorithm the opinion is extracted and represented.
