Asymptotic Deployment Gain: A Simple Approach to Characterize the SINR Distribution in General Cellular Networks

In cellular network models, the base stations are usually assumed to form a lattice or a Poisson point process (PPP). In reality, however, they are deployed neither fully regularly nor completely randomly. Accordingly, in this paper, we consider the very general class of motion-invariant models and analyze the behavior of the outage probability (the probability that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) is smaller than a threshold) as the threshold goes to zero. We show that, remarkably, the slope of the outage probability (in dB) as a function of the threshold (also in dB) is the same for essentially all motion-invariant point processes. The slope merely depends on the fading statistics. Using this result, we introduce the notion of the asymptotic deployment gain (ADG), which characterizes the horizontal gap between the success probabilities of the PPP and another point process in the high-reliability regime (where the success probability is near 1). To demonstrate the usefulness of the ADG for the characterization of the SINR distribution, we investigate the outage probabilities and the ADGs for different point processes and fading statistics by simulations.
