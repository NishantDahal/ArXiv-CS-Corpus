Heuristic-based Optimal Resource Provisioning in Application-centric Cloud

Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) adapt different pricing models for their offered services. Some of the models are suitable for short term requirement while others may be suitable for the Cloud Service User's (CSU) long term requirement. In this paper, we look at the problem of finding the amount of resources to be reserved to satisfy the CSU's long term demands with the aim of minimizing the total cost. Finding the optimal resource requirement to satisfy the the CSU's demand for resources needs sufficient research effort. Various algorithms were discussed in the last couple of years for finding the optimal resource requirement but most of them are based on IPP which is NP in nature. In this paper, we derive some heuristic-based polynomial time algorithms to find some near optimal solution to the problem. We show that the cost for CSU using our approach is comparable to the solution obtained using optimal Integer Programming Problem(IPP).
