Block-Structured Supermarket Models

Supermarket models are a class of parallel queueing networks with an adaptive control scheme that play a key role in the study of resource management of, such as, computer networks, manufacturing systems and transportation networks. When the arrival processes are non-Poisson and the service times are non-exponential, analysis of such a supermarket model is always limited, interesting, and challenging.
  This paper describes a supermarket model with non-Poisson inputs: Markovian Arrival Processes (MAPs) and with non-exponential service times: Phase-type (PH) distributions, and provides a generalized matrix-analytic method which is first combined with the operator semigroup and the mean-field limit. When discussing such a more general supermarket model, this paper makes some new results and advances as follows: (1) Providing a detailed probability analysis for setting up an infinite-dimensional system of differential vector equations satisfied by the expected fraction vector, where "the invariance of environment factors" is given as an important result. (2) Introducing the phase-type structure to the operator semigroup and to the mean-field limit, and a Lipschitz condition can be obtained by means of a unified matrix-differential algorithm. (3) The matrix-analytic method is used to compute the fixed point which leads to performance computation of this system. Finally, we use some numerical examples to illustrate how the performance measures of this supermarket model depend on the non-Poisson inputs and on the non-exponential service times. Thus the results of this paper give new highlight on understanding influence of non-Poisson inputs and of non-exponential service times on performance measures of more general supermarket models.
