Lossy Source Coding with Reconstruction Privacy

We consider the problem of lossy source coding with side information under a privacy constraint that the reconstruction sequence at a decoder should be kept secret to a certain extent from another terminal such as an eavesdropper, a sender, or a helper. We are interested in how the reconstruction privacy constraint at a particular terminal affects the rate-distortion tradeoff. In this work, we allow the decoder to use a random mapping, and give inner and outer bounds to the rate-distortion-equivocation region for different cases where the side information is available non-causally and causally at the decoder. In the special case where each reconstruction symbol depends only on the source description and current side information symbol, the complete rate-distortion-equivocation region is provided. A binary example illustrating a new tradeoff due to the new privacy constraint, and a gain from the use of a stochastic decoder is given.
