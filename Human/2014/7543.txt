A Fuzzy Differential Evolution Algorithm for Job Scheduling on Computational Grids

Grid computing is the recently growing area of computing that share data, storage, computing across geographically dispersed area. This paper proposes a novel fuzzy approach using Differential Evolution (DE) for scheduling jobs on computational grids. The fuzzy based DE generates an optimal plan to complete the jobs within a minimum period of time. We evaluate the performance of the proposed fuzzy based DE algorithm with Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), Differential Evolution and fuzzy PSO. Experimental results have shown that the new algorithm produces more optimal solutions for the job scheduling problems compared to other algorithms.
