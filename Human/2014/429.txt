The critical factors affecting E-Government adoption: A Conceptual Framework in Vietnam

Electronic government (e-government) has established as an effective mechanism for increasing government productivity and efficiency and a key enabler of citizen- centric services. However, e-government implementation is surrounded by technological, governing and social issues, which have to be considered and treated carefully in order to facilitate this change. This research attempts to explore and investigate the key challenges that influence e-government implementation and the factors influencing citizen adoption in Vietnam. It develops a conceptual framework on the basis of existing experiences drawn from administrative reforms. Survey data from public employee will be used to test the proposed hypothesis and the model. Therefore, this research has identified factors that determine if the citizen will adopt E-government services and thereby aiding governments in accessing what is required to increase adoption. We will also highlight several research, practitioner and policy implications.
