Using Apriori with WEKA for Frequent Pattern Mining

Knowledge exploration from the large set of data,generated as a result of the various data processing activities due to data mining only. Frequent Pattern Mining is a very important undertaking in data mining. Apriori approach applied to generate frequent item set generally espouse candidate generation and pruning techniques for the satisfaction of the desired objective. This paper shows how the different approaches achieve the objective of frequent mining along with the complexities required to perform the job. This paper demonstrates the use of WEKA tool for association rule mining using Apriori algorithm.
