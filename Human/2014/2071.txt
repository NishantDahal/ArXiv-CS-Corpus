In-Memory Database Systems - A Paradigm Shift

In today world, organizations like Google, Yahoo, Amazon, Facebook etc. are facing drastic increase in data. This leads to the problem of capturing, storing, managing and analyzing terabytes or petabytes of data, stored in multiple formats, from different internal and external sources. Moreover, new applications scenarios like weather forecasting, trading, artificial intelligence etc. need huge data processing in real time. These requirements exceed the processing capacity of traditional on-disk database management systems to manage this data and to give speedy real time results. Therefore, data management needs new solutions for coping with the challenges of data volumes and processing data in real-time. An in-memory database system (IMDS) is a latest breed of database management system which is becoming answer to above challenges with other supporting technologies. IMDS is capable to process massive data distinctly faster. This paper explores IMDS approach and its associated design issues and challenges. It also investigates some famous commercial and open-source IMDS solutions available in the market.
