Managing Congestion Control in Mobile AD-HOC Network Using Mobile Agents

In mobile adhoc networks, congestion occurs with limited resources. The standard TCP congestion control mechanism is not able to handle the special properties of a shared wireless channel. TCP congestion control works very well on the Internet. But mobile adhoc networks exhibit some unique properties that greatly affect the design of appropriate protocols and protocol stacks in general, and of congestion control mechanism in particular. As it turned out, the vastly differing environment in a mobile adhoc network is highly problematic for standard TCP. Many approaches have been proposed to overcome these difficulties. Mobile agent based congestion control Technique is proposed to avoid congestion in adhoc network. When mobile agent travels through the network, it can select a less-loaded neighbor node as its next hop and update the routing table according to the node congestion status. With the aid of mobile agents, the nodes can get the dynamic network topology in time. In this paper, a mobile agent based congestion control mechanism is presented.
