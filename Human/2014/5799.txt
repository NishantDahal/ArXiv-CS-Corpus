A General Homogeneous Matrix Formulation to 3D Rotation Geometric Transformations

We present algebraic projective geometry definitions of 3D rotations so as to bridge a small gap between the applications and the definitions of 3D rotations in homogeneous matrix form. A general homogeneous matrix formulation to 3D rotation geometric transformations is proposed which suits for the cases when the rotation axis is unnecessarily through the coordinate system origin given their rotation axes and rotation angles.
