Multiuser Joint Energy-Bandwidth Allocation with Energy Harvesting - Part I: Optimum Algorithm & Multiple Point-to-Point Channels

In this paper, we develop optimal energy-bandwidth allocation algorithms in fading channels for multiple energy harvesting transmitters, each may communicate with multiple receivers via orthogonal channels. We first assume that the side information of both the channel states and the energy harvesting states is known for $K$ time slots {\em a priori}, and the battery capacity and the maximum transmission power in each time slot are bounded. The objective is to maximize the weighted sum-rate of all transmitters over the $K$ time slots by assigning the transmission power and bandwidth for each transmitter in each slot. The problem is formulated as a convex optimization problem with ${\cal O}(MK)$ constraints, where $M$ is the number of the receivers, making it hard to solve with a generic convex solver. An iterative algorithm is proposed that alternatively solves two subproblems in each iteration. The convergence and the optimality of this algorithm are also shown. We then consider the special case that each transmitter only communicates with one receiver and the objective is to maximize the total throughput. We develop efficient algorithms for solving the two subproblems and the optimal energy-bandwidth allocation can be obtained with an overall complexity of ${\cal O}(MK^2)$. Moreover, a heuristic algorithm is also proposed for energy-bandwidth allocation based on causal information of channel and energy harvesting states.
