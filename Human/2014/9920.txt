Enhanced Pilot-Based Spectrum Sensing Algorithm

In this paper, we develop an enhanced pilot-based spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio. Unlike conventional pilot-based detectors which merely detect the presence of pilot signals, the proposed detector also utilizes the presence of the signal that carries the actual information. We analytically compare the performance of the proposed detector with the conventional one, and we show that the detection performance is significantly improved.
