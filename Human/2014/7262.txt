AstraKahn: A Coordination Language for Streaming Networks

This is a preliminary version of the language report. It contains key definitions, specifications and some examples, but lacks completeness. The full document will include Chapter 3 (Data and Instrumentation Layer) and will comprise an appendix giving the complete syntax and some whole program examples. The purpose of the present document is to fix the concepts and major features of the language and to enable the production of the definition document that is required for implementation.
