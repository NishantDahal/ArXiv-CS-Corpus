IEEE 802.11ah: The Wi-Fi Approach for M2M Communications

M2M communications are projected to be one of the fastest growing technology segments of the IT sector in the next years. Sensor and actuator networks connect communication machines and devices so that they automatically transmit information, serving the growing demand for environmental data acquisition. IEEE 802.11ah Task Group addresses the creation of a new standard for giving response to the particular requirements of this type of networks: large number of power-constrained stations, long transmission range, small and infrequent data messages, low data-rates and non-critical delay. This article explores the key features of this new standard under development, especially those related to the reduction of energy consumption in the MAC Layer. In this direction, a performance assessment of IEEE 802.11ah in four typical M2M scenarios has been performed.
