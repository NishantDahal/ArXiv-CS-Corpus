Standard decomposition of expansive ergodically supported dynamics

In this work we introduce the notion of weak quasigroups, that are quasigroup operations defined almost everywhere on some set. Then we prove that the topological entropy and the ergodic period of an invertible expansive ergodically supported dynamical system $(X,T)$ with the shadowing property establishes a sufficient criterion for the existence of quasigroup operations defined almost everywhere outside of universally null sets and for which $T$ is an automorphism. Furthermore, we find a decomposition of the dynamics of $T$ in terms of $T$-invariant weak topological subquasigroups.
