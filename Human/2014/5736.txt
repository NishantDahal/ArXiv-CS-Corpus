Representation of a Sentence using a Polar Fuzzy Neutrosophic Semantic Net

A semantic net can be used to represent a sentence. A sentence in a language contains semantics which are polar in nature, that is, semantics which are positive, neutral and negative. Neutrosophy is a relatively new field of science which can be used to mathematically represent triads of concepts. These triads include truth, indeterminacy and falsehood, and so also positivity, neutrality and negativity. Thus a conventional semantic net has been extended in this paper using neutrosophy into a Polar Fuzzy Neutrosophic Semantic Net. A Polar Fuzzy Neutrosophic Semantic Net has been implemented in MATLAB and has been used to illustrate a polar sentence in English language. The paper demonstrates a method for the representation of polarity in a computers memory. Thus, polar concepts can be applied to imbibe a machine such as a robot, with emotions, making machine emotion representation possible.
