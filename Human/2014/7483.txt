Sampled-Data H-infinity Design of Coupling Wave Cancelers in Single-Frequency Full-Duplex Relay Stations

In this article, we propose sampled-data H-infinity design of digital filters that cancel the continuous-time effect of coupling waves in a single-frequency full-duplex relay station. In this study, we model a relay station as a continuous-time system while conventional researches treat it as a discrete-time system. For a continuous-time model, we propose digital feedforward and feedback cancelers based on the sampled-data control theory to cancel coupling waves taking intersample behavior into account. Simulation results are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
