Normal variation for adaptive feature size

The change in the normal between any two nearby points on a closed, smooth surface is bounded with respect to the local feature size (distance to the medial axis). An incorrect proof of this lemma appeared as part of the analysis of the "crust" algorithm of Amenta and Bern.
