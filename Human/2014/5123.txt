Commutative Languages and their Composition by Consensual Methods

Commutative  languages with the semilinear property (SLIP)  can be naturally recognized by real-time NLOG-SPACE multi-counter machines. We show that unions and concatenations of such languages can be  similarly recognized, relying on -- and further developing, our recent results on the family of consensually regular (CREG) languages.  A CREG language is defined by a regular language on the alphabet that includes the terminal alphabet and its marked copy. New  conditions, for ensuring that the union or concatenation of CREG languages is  closed,  are presented and applied to the commutative SLIP languages. The paper contributes to the knowledge of the CREG family, and introduces novel   techniques for language composition, based on arithmetic congruences that act as language signatures. Open problems are listed.
