Different Types of Conflicting Knowledge in AmI Environments

We characterize different types of conflicts that may occur in complex distributed multi-agent scenarios, such as in Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments, and we argue that these conflicts should be resolved in a suitable order and with the appropriate strategies for each individual conflict type. We call for further research with the goal of turning conflict resolution in AmI environments and similar multi-agent domains into a more coordinated and agreed upon process.
