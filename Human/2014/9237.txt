The Size of Software Projects Developed by Mexican Companies

Currently, most software projects around the world are small rather than large. Despite this, there are more methodologies, tools, frameworks, processes, and so on, for developing and managing large software projects than for small ones. Small software projects are important because they generate considerable resources. For example: apps (small mobile applications) generate around $25 billion dollars of revenue. This paper shows our findings regarding the size of the projects built by Mexican software development companies. We surveyed 107 Mexican companies and found that 92% of their developed projects are micro and small, and 8% are medium or large. In addition, according to our research, 84.1% of companies in Mexico are micro or small businesses.
