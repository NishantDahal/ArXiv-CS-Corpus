Formal Specification Language Based IaaS Cloud Workload Regression Analysis

Cloud Computing is an emerging area for accessing computing resources. In general, Cloud service providers offer services that can be clustered into three categories: SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. This paper discusses the Cloud workload analysis. The efficient Cloud workload resource mapping technique is proposed. This paper aims to provide a means of understanding and investigating IaaS Cloud workloads and the resources. In this paper, regression analysis is used to analyze the Cloud workloads and identifies the relationship between Cloud workloads and available resources. The effective organization of dynamic nature resources can be done with the help of Cloud workloads. Till Cloud workload is considered a vital talent, the Cloud resources cannot be consumed in an effective style. The proposed technique has been validated by Z Formal specification language. This approach is effective in minimizing the cost and submission burst time of Cloud workloads.
