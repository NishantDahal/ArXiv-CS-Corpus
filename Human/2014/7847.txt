Car-following model on two lanes and stability analysis

Considering lateral influence from adjacent lane, an improved car-following model is developed in this paper. Then linear and non-linear stability analyses are carried out. The modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation is derived with the kink-antikink soliton solution. Numerical simulations are implemented and the result shows good consistency with theoretical study.
