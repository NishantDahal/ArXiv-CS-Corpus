Stepwise Refinement of Data Flow Architectures

This paper aims at integrating heterogeneous documents used in pragmatic software develpoment methods to describe views with a formal refinement based software development process. Therefore we propose an integrated semantics of heterogeneous documents based on a common system model and a set of syntactic development steps with a welldefined semantics for document evolution. The use of the development steps is demonstrated in a small example.
