Successive Optimization Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding Strategies for Physical-Layer Security in Wireless Networks

In this paper, we propose successive optimization non-linear precoding strategies for physical-layer security in wireless networks. We also investigate different precoding techniques for multi-user MIMO systems under various conditions of channel state information (CSI) between the access point and the users and the eavesdroppers. A non-linear precoding technique based on Successive Optimization Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (SO-THP) and Simplified Generalized Matrix Inversion (S-GMI) technique is proposed along with a strategy for injecting artificial noise prior to transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed SO-THP+S-GMI precoding technique outperforms existing non-linear and linear precoding algorithms in terms of BER and secrecy rate performances.
