An Expert System for Automatic Reading of A Text Written in Standard Arabic

In this work we present our expert system of Automatic reading or speech synthesis based on a text written in Standard Arabic, our work is carried out in two great stages: the creation of the sound data base, and the transformation of the written text into speech (Text To Speech TTS). This transformation is done firstly by a Phonetic Orthographical Transcription (POT) of any written Standard Arabic text with the aim of transforming it into his corresponding phonetics sequence, and secondly by the generation of the voice signal which corresponds to the chain transcribed. We spread out the different of conception of the system, as well as the results obtained compared to others works studied to realize TTS based on Standard Arabic.
