A bound on a convexity measure for point sets

A planar point set is in convex position precisely when it has a convex polygonization, that is, a polygonization with maximum interior angle measure at most Ï€. We can thus talk about the convexity of a set of points in terms of the minimum, taken over all polygonizations, of the maximum interior angle. The main result presented here is a nontrivial combinatorial upper bound of this min-max value in terms of the number of points in the set. Motivated by a particular construction, we also pose a natural conjecture for the best upper bound.
