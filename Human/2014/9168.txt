Followers or Phantoms? An Anatomy of Purchased Twitter Followers

Online Social Media (OSM) is extensively used by contemporary Internet users to communicate, socialize and disseminate information. This has led to the creation of a distinct online social identity which in turn has created the need of online social reputation management techniques. A significant percentage of OSM users utilize various methods to drive and manage their reputation on OSM. This has given rise to underground markets which buy/sell fraudulent accounts, `likes', `comments' (Facebook, Instagram) and `followers' (Twitter) to artificially boost their social reputation. In this study, we present an anatomy of purchased followers on Twitter and their behaviour. We illustrate in detail the profile characteristics, content sharing and behavioural patterns of purchased follower accounts.
  Previous studies have analyzed the purchased follower markets and customers. Ours is the first study which analyzes the anatomy of purchased followers accounts. Some of the key insights of our study show that purchased followers have a very high unfollow entropy rate and low social engagement with their friends. In addition, we noticed that purchased follower accounts have significant difference in their interaction and content sharing patterns in comparison to random Twitter users. We also found that underground markets do not follow their service policies and guarantees they provide to customer. Our study highlights the key identifiers for suspicious follow behaviour. We then built a supervised learning mechanism to predict suspicious follower behaviour with 88.2% accuracy. We believe that understanding the anatomy and characteristics of purchased followers can help detect suspicious follower behaviour and fraudulent accounts to a larger extent.
