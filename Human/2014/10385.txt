Exercises for Children with Dyslalia-Software Infrastructure

In order to help children with dyslalia we created a set of software exercises. This set has a unitary software block (data base, programming language, programming philosophy). In this paper we present this software infrastructure with its advantage and disadvantage. The exercises are part of a software system named LOGOMON. Therefore, besides horizontal compatibilities (between exercises) vertical compatibilities are also presented (with LOGOMON system). Concerning database tables used for modulus of exercises, a part of them is "inherited" from LOGOMON application and another are specific for exercises application. We also need to specify that there were necessary minor changes of database tables used by LOGOMON. As programming language we used C#, implemented in Visual Studio 2005. We developed specific interfaces elements and classes. We also used multimedia resources that were necessary for exercises (images, correct pronouncing obtained from speech therapist recording, video clips). Another section of this application is related to loading of exercises on mobile devices (Pocket PC). A part of code has been imported directly, but there were a lot of files that need to be rewritten. Anyway, the multimedia resources were used without any processing.
