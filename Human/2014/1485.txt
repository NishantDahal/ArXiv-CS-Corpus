On the Algebraic Structure of Linear Trellises

Trellises are crucial graphical representations of codes. While conventional trellises are well understood, the general theory of (tail-biting) trellises is still under development. Iterative decoding concretely motivates such theory. In this paper we first develop a new algebraic framework for a systematic analysis of linear trellises which enables us to address open foundational questions. In particular, we present a useful and powerful characterization of linear trellis isomorphy. We also obtain a new proof of the Factorization Theorem of Koetter/Vardy and point out unnoticed problems for the group case.
  Next, we apply our work to: describe all the elementary trellis factorizations of linear trellises and consequently to determine all the minimal linear trellises for a given code; prove that nonmergeable one-to-one linear trellises are strikingly determined by the edge-label sequences of certain closed paths; prove self-duality theorems for minimal linear trellises; analyze quasi-cyclic linear trellises and consequently extend results on reduced linear trellises to nonreduced ones. To achieve this, we also provide new insight into mergeability and path connectivity properties of linear trellises.
  Our classification results are important for iterative decoding as we show that minimal linear trellises can yield different pseudocodewords even if they have the same graph structure.
