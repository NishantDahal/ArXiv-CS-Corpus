Asymptotic Analysis of SU-MIMO Channels With Transmitter Noise and Mismatched Joint Decoding

Hardware impairments in radio-frequency components of a wireless system cause unavoidable distortions to transmission that are not captured by the conventional linear channel model. In this paper, a 'binoisy' single-user multiple-input multiple-output (SU-MIMO) relation is considered where the additional distortions are modeled via an additive noise term at the transmit side. Through this extended SU-MIMO channel model, the effects of transceiver hardware impairments on the achievable rate of multi-antenna point-to-point systems are studied. Channel input distributions encompassing practical discrete modulation schemes, such as, QAM and PSK, as well as Gaussian signaling are covered. In addition, the impact of mismatched detection and decoding when the receiver has insufficient information about the non-idealities is investigated. The numerical results show that for realistic system parameters, the effects of transmit-side noise and mismatched decoding become significant only at high modulation orders.
