Real-Time Notification for Resource Synchronization

Web applications frequently leverage resources made available by remote web servers. As resources are created, updated, deleted, or moved, these applications face challenges to remain in lockstep with the server's change dynamics. Several approaches exist to help meet this challenge for use cases where "good enough" synchronization is acceptable. But when strict resource coverage or low synchronization latency is required, commonly accepted Web-based solutions remain elusive. This paper details characteristics of an approach that aims at decreasing synchronization latency while maintaining desired levels of accuracy. The approach builds on pushing change notifications and pulling changed resources and it is explored with an experiment based on a DBpedia Live instance.
