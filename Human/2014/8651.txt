MOR Cryptosystem and classical Chevalley groups in odd characteristic

In this paper we study the MOR cryptosystem using finite classical Chevalley groups over a finite field of odd characteristic. In the process we develop an algorithm for these Chevalley groups in the same spirit as the row-column operation for special linear group. We focus our study on orthogonal and symplectic groups. We find the hardness of the proposed MOR cryptosystem for these groups.
