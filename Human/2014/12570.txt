Person Re-identification Based on Color Histogram and Spatial Configuration of Dominant Color Regions

There is a requirement to determine whether a given person of interest has already been observed over a network of cameras in video surveillance systems. A human appearance obtained in one camera is usually different from the ones obtained in another camera due to difference in illumination, pose and viewpoint, camera parameters. Being related to appearance-based approaches for person re-identification, we propose a novel method based on the dominant color histogram and spatial configuration of dominant color regions on human body parts. Dominant color histogram and spatial configuration of the dominant color regions based on dominant color descriptor(DCD) can be considered to be robust to illumination and pose, viewpoint changes. The proposed method is evaluated using benchmark video datasets. Experimental results using the cumulative matching characteristic(CMC) curve demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for person re-identification.
