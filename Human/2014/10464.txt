Implementation of an adaptive energy-efficient MAC protocol in OMNeT++/MiXiM

In recent years, many MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks have been proposed and most of them are evaluated using Matlab simulator and/or network simulators (OMNeT++, NS2, etc). However, most of them have a static behavior and few network simulations are available for adaptive protocols. Specially, in OMNeT++/MiXiM, there are few energy-efficient MAC protocols for WSNs (B-MAC & L-MAC) and no adaptive ones. To this end, the TAD-MAC (Traffic Aware Dynamic MAC) protocol has been simulated in OMNeT++ with the MiXiM framework and implementation details are given in this paper. The simulation results have been used to evaluate the performance of TAD-MAC through comparisons with B-MAC and L-MAC protocols.
