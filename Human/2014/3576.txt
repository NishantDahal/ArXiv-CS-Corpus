Real-Time Estimation of the Distribution of Brake Response Times for an Individual Driver Using Vehicular Ad Hoc Network

Adapting the functioning of the collision warning systems to the specific drivers' characteristics is of great benefit to drivers. For example, by customizing collision warning algorithms we can minimize false alarms, thereby reducing injuries and deaths in highway traffic accidents. In order to take the behaviors of individual drivers into account, the system needs to have a Real-Time estimation of the distribution of brake response times for an individual driver. In this paper, we propose a method for doing this estimation which is not computationally intensive and can take advantage of the information contained in all data points.
