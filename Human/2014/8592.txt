Mutualistic Relationships in Service-Oriented Communities and Fractal Social Organizations

In this paper we consider two social organizations -- service-oriented communities and fractal organizations -- and discuss how their main characteristics provide an answer to several shortcomings of traditional organizations. In particular, we highlight their ability to tap into the vast basins of "social energy" of our societies. This is done through the establishing of mutualistic relationships among the organizational components. The paper also introduces a mathematical model of said mutualistic processes as well as its translation in terms of semantic service description and matching. Preliminary investigations of the resilience of fractal social organizations are reported. Simulations show that fractal organizations outperform non-fractal organizations and are able to quickly recover from disruptions and changes characterizing dynamic environments.
