Adaptive two-dimensional wavelet transformation based on the Haar system

The purpose is to study qualitative and quantitative rates of image compression by using different Haar wavelet banks. The experimental results of adaptive compression are provided. The paper deals with specific examples of orthogonal Haar bases generated by multiresolution analysis. Bases consist of three piecewise constant wavelet functions with a support $[0,1] \times [0,1] $.
