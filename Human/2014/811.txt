Inifnite hypercomplex number system factorization methods

The method of obtaining the set of noncanonical hypercomplex number systems by conversion of infinite hypercomplex number system to finite hypercomplex number system depending on multiplication rules and factorization method is described. Systems obtained by this method starting from the 3rddimension are noncanonical. The obtained systems of even dimension can be re-factorized. As a result of it hypercomplex number system of two times less dimension are got.
