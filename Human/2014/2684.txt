One-sided asymptotically mean stationary channels

This paper proposes an analysis of asymptotically mean stationary (AMS) communication channels. A hierarchy based on stability properties (stationarity, quasi-stationarity, recurrence and asymptotically mean stationarity) of channels is identified. Stationary channels are a subclass of quasi-stationary channels which are a subclass of recurrent AMS channels which are a subclass of AMS channels. These classes are proved to be stable under Markovian composition of channels (e.g., the cascade of AMS channels is an AMS channel). Characterizations of channels of each class are given. Some properties of the quasi-stationary mean of a channel are established. Finally, ergodicity conditions of AMS channels are gathered.
