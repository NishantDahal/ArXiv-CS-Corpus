Compute-and-Forward for the Interference Channel: Diversity Precoding

Interference Alignment is a new solution to over- come the problem of interference in multiuser wireless com- munication systems. Recently, the Compute-and-Forward (CF) transform has been proposed to approximate the capacity of K- user Gaussian Symmetric Interference Channel and practically perform Interference Alignment in wireless networks. However, this technique shows a random behavior in the achievable sum- rate, especially at high SNR. In this work, the origin of this random behavior is analyzed and a novel precoding technique based on the Golden Ratio is proposed to scale down the fadings experiences by the achievable sum-rate at high SNR.
