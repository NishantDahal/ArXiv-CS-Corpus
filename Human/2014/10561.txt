Collaboration on Social Media: Analyzing Successful Projects on Social Coding

Social Coding Sites (SCSs) are social media services for sharing software development projects on the Web, and many open source projects are currently being developed on SCSs. One of the characteristics of SCSs is that they provide a platform on social networks that encourages collaboration between developers with the same interests and purpose. For example, external developers can easily report bugs and improvements to the project members. In this paper, we investigate keys to the success of projects on SCSs based on large data consisting of more than three hundred thousand projects. We focus on the following three perspectives: 1) the team structure, 2) social activity with external developers, and 3) content developed by the project. To evaluate the success quantitatively, we define activity, popularity and sociality as success indexes. A summary of the findings we obtained by using the techniques of correlation analysis, social network analysis and topic extraction is as follows: the number of project members and the connectivity between the members are positively correlated with success indexes. Second, projects that faithfully tackle change requests from external developers are more likely to be successful. Third, the success indexes differ between topics of softwares developed by projects. Our analysis suggests how to be successful in various projects, not limited to social coding.
