Partial-MDS Codes and their Application to RAID Type of Architectures

A family of codes with a natural two-dimensional structure is presented, inspired by an application of RAID type of architectures whose units are solid state drives (SSDs). Arrays of SSDs behave differently to arrays of hard disk drives (HDDs), since hard errors in sectors are common and traditional RAID approaches (like RAID 5 or RAID 6) may be either insufficient or excessive. An efficient solution to this problem is given by the new codes presented, called partial-MDS (PMDS) codes.
