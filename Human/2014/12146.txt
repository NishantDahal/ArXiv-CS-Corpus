$Υ$-DB: A system for data-driven hypothesis management and analytics

The vision of $Υ$-DB introduces deterministic scientific hypotheses as a kind of uncertain and probabilistic data, and opens some key technical challenges for enabling data-driven hypothesis management and analytics. The $Υ$-DB system addresses those challenges throughout a design-by-synthesis pipeline that defines its architecture. It processes hypotheses from their XML-based extraction to encoding as uncertain and probabilistic U-relational data, and eventually to their conditioning in the presence of observations. In this demo we present a first prototype of the $Υ$-DB system. We showcase its core innovative features by means of use case scenarios in computational science in which the hypotheses are extracted from a model repository on the web and evaluated (rated/ranked) as probabilistic data.
