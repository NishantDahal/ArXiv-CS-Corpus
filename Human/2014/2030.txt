New LDPC Codes Using Permutation Matrices with Higher Girth than QC-LDPC Codes Constructed by Fossorier

In the literatures, it is well-known that Fossorier code has the girth among LDPC codes. In this paper, we introduce a new class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, with higher girth than other previous constructed codes. Especially we proposed a new method to construct LDPC codes using non fixed shift permutation matrices and full based matrices with higher girth than codes constructed by Fossorier.
