Surfaces Representation with Sharp Features Using Sqrt(3) and Loop Subdivision Schemes

This paper presents a hybrid algorithm that combines features form both Sqrt(3) and Loop Subdivision schemes. The algorithm aims at preserving sharp features and trim regions, during the surfaces subdivision, using a set of rules. The implementation is nontrivial due to the computational, topological, and smoothness constraints, which should be satisfied by the underlying surface. The fundamental innovation, in this research work, is the ability to preserve sharp features anywhere on a surface. In addition, the resulting representation remains within the multiresolution subdivision framework. Preserving the original representation has a core advantage that all the applicable operations to the multiresolution subdivision surfaces can subsequently be applied to the edited model. Experimental results, including surfaces coarsening and smoothing, were performed using the proposed algorithm for validation purposes, and the results revealed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other recent state of the art algorithms.
