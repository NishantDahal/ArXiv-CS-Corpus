Enable Portrait Privacy Protection in Photo Capturing and Sharing

The wide adoption of wearable smart devices with onboard cameras greatly increases people's concern on privacy infringement. Here we explore the possibility of easing persons from photos captured by smart devices according to their privacy protection requirements. To make this work, we need to address two challenges: 1) how to let users explicitly express their privacy protection intention, and 2) how to associate the privacy requirements with persons in captured photos accurately and efficiently. Furthermore, the association process itself should not cause portrait information leakage and should be accomplished in a privacy-preserving way. In this work, we design, develop, and evaluate a protocol, that enables a user to flexibly express her privacy requirement and empowers the photo service provider (or image taker) to exert the privacy protection policy.Leveraging the visual distinguishability of people in the field-of-view and the dimension-order-independent property of vector similarity measurement, we achieves high accuracy and low overhead.
  We implement a prototype system, and our evaluation results on both the trace-driven and real-life experiments confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our system.
