Holographic Transformation for Quantum Factor Graphs

Recently, a general tool called a holographic transformation, which transforms an expression of the partition function to another form, has been used for polynomial-time algorithms and for improvement and understanding of the belief propagation. In this work, the holographic transformation is generalized to quantum factor graphs.
