Design of a Hybrid Robot Control System using Memristor-Model and Ant-Inspired Based Information Transfer Protocols

It is not always possible for a robot to process all the information from its sensors in a timely manner and thus quick and yet valid approximations of the robot's situation are needed. Here we design hybrid control for a robot within this limit using algorithms inspired by ant worker placement behaviour and based on memristor-based non-linearity.
