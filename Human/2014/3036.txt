Baselining Wireless Internet Service Development: An Experience Report

New, emerging domains such as the engineering of wireless Internet services are characterized by a lack of experience based on quantitative data. Systematic tracking and observation of representative pilot projects can be seen as one means to capture experience, get valuable insight into a new domain, and build initial baselines. This helps to improve the planning of real development projects in business units. This article describes an approach to capture software development experience for the wireless Internet services domain by conducting and observing a series of case studies in the field. Initial baselines concerning effort distribution from the development of two wireless Internet pilot services are presented. Furthermore, major domain-specific risk factors are discussed based on the results of project retrospectives conducted with the developers of the services.
