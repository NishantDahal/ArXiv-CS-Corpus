A Lower Bound for the Fisher Information Measure

The problem how to approximately determine the absolute value of the Fisher information measure for a general parametric probabilistic system is considered. Having available the first and second moment of the system output in a parametric form, it is shown that the information measure can be bounded from below through a replacement of the original system by a Gaussian system with equivalent moments. The presented technique is applied to a system of practical importance and the potential quality of the bound is demonstrated.
