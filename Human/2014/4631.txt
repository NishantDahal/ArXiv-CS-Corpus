Cache policies for cloud-based systems: To keep or not to keep

In this paper, we study cache policies for cloud-based caching. Cloud-based caching uses cloud storage services such as Amazon S3 as a cache for data items that would have been recomputed otherwise. Cloud-based caching departs from classical caching: cloud resources are potentially infinite and only paid when used, while classical caching relies on a fixed storage capacity and its main monetary cost comes from the initial investment. To deal with this new context, we design and evaluate a new caching policy that minimizes the overall cost of a cloud-based system. The policy takes into account the frequency of consumption of an item and the cloud cost model. We show that this policy is easier to operate, that it scales with the demand and that it outperforms classical policies managing a fixed capacity.
