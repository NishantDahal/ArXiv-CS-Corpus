Collaborative Discriminant Locality Preserving Projections With its Application to Face Recognition

We present a novel Discriminant Locality Preserving Projections (DLPP) algorithm named Collaborative Discriminant Locality Preserving Projection (CDLPP). In our algorithm, the discriminating power of DLPP are further exploited from two aspects. On the one hand, the global optimum of class scattering is guaranteed via using the between-class scatter matrix to replace the original denominator of DLPP. On the other hand, motivated by collaborative representation, an $L_2$-norm constraint is imposed to the projections to discover the collaborations of dimensions in the sample space. We apply our algorithm to face recognition. Three popular face databases, namely AR, ORL and LFW-A, are employed for evaluating the performance of CDLPP. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CDLPP significantly improves the discriminating power of DLPP and outperforms the state-of-the-arts.
