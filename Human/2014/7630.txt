TFPaaS : Test-first Performance as a Service to Cloud for Software Testing Environment

Performance Testing is critical for applications like web services and e-commerce platforms to ensure enhanced end user experience. In such cases, starting to test the system's performance early should significantly reduce the overall development cost. Test-first Performance (TFP) is one such paradigm that allows performance testing right from the early stage of development. Given such potential benefit, this paper proposes the design of a testing framework IVRIDIO which introduces TFP as a Service (TFPaaS). IVRIDIO incorporates the Plugin for TFP in the Cloud (PTFPC) aiming to provide instant feedbacks - a prime requirement of TFP to immediately fix critical performance issues. Furthermore, the Convention over Configuration (CoC) design paradigm has been applied by introducing a configurable project template to maintain TFP test cases. The prototyping details of the framework are given and the variation of response time to the inclusion of PTFPC has also been discussed. The Summated Usability Metric (SUM) score has been provided so that it can later be used for comparing the PTFPC plugin's usability.
