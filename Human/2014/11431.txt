An Algorithm for Mining High Utility Closed Itemsets and Generators

Traditional association rule mining based on the support-confidence framework provides the objective measure of the rules that are of interest to users. However, it does not reflect the utility of the rules. To extract non-redundant association rules in support-confidence framework frequent closed itemsets and their generators play an important role. To extract non-redundant association rules among high utility itemsets, high utility closed itemsets (HUCI) and their generators should be extracted in order to apply traditional support-confidence framework. However, no efficient method exists at present for mining HUCIs with their generators. This paper addresses this issue. A post-processing algorithm, called the HUCI-Miner, is proposed to mine HUCIs with their generators. The proposed algorithm is implemented using both synthetic and real datasets.
