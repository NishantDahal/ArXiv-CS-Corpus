The Effective Solving of the Tasks from NP by a Quantum Computer

The new model of quantum computation is proposed, for which an effective algorithm of solving any task in NP is described. The work is based and inspired be the Grover's algorithm for solving NP-tasks with quadratic speedup compared to the classical computation model. The provided model and algorithm exhibit the exponential speedup over that described by Grover.
