Concept Based vs. Pseudo Relevance Feedback Performance Evaluation for Information Retrieval System

This article evaluates the performance of two techniques for query reformulation in a system for information retrieval, namely, the concept based and the pseudo relevance feedback reformulation. The experiments performed on a corpus of Arabic text have allowed us to compare the contribution of these two reformulation techniques in improving the performance of an information retrieval system for Arabic texts.
