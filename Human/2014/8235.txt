Systematic Design of Trust Management Systems for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Review

Conventional cryptography methods alone are not adequate for secure routing in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). These networks are more vulnerable to security attacks due to their diverse applications, lack of supervision and limitations in view of resource, processing and storage. To mitigate these problems, trust is widely used as a tool to provide better security by aiding routing protocols. In recent years, numerous researchers have proposed wide variety of solutions based on trust. However, all these solutions carry their own design. In this paper, we attempt to present steps for a systematic design of trust management systems for WSNs. In addition, we address the techniques followed by scholars in implementing trust frameworks. Furthermore, we provide discussion on state-of-the-art research in designing trust systems with summary and comparisons.
