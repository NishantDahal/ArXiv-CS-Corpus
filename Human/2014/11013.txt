The probatilistic Quantifier Fuzzification Mechanism FA: A theoretical analysis

The main goal of this work is to analyze the behaviour of the FA quantifier fuzzification mechanism. As we prove in the paper, this model has a very solid theorethical behaviour, superior to most of the models defined in the literature. Moreover, we show that the underlying probabilistic interpretation has very interesting consequences.
