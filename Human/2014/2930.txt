Distributed Transformer Monitoring System Based On Zigbee Technology

A Distributed transformer networks remote monitoring system is developed and constructed,for monitor and record the parameters like temperature, oil level status, of a distribution transformer.The system consists of a micro controller based circuit,with solid-state components for handling sensors,power back-up,real time clock and data communication module which based on ZigBee protocol.
