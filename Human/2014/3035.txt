HoTT formalisation in Coq: Dependency Graphs \& ML4PG

This note is a response to Bas Spitter's email of 28 February 2014 about ML4PG:
  "We (Jason actually) are adding dependency graphs to our HoTT library: https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/wiki
  I seem to recall that finding the dependency graph was a main obstacle preventing machine learning to be used in Coq. However, you seem to have made progress on this. What tool are you using? https://anne.pacalet.fr/dev/dpdgraph/ ? Or another tool? Would it be easy to use your ML4PG on the HoTT library?"
  This note gives explanation of how ML4PG can be used in the HoTT library and how ML4PG relates to the two kinds of Dependency graphs available in Coq.
