Saccadic Eye Movements and the Generalized Pareto Distribution

We describe a statistical analysis of the eye tracker measurements in a database with 15 observers viewing 1003 images under free-viewing conditions. In contrast to the common approach of investigating the properties of the fixation points we analyze the properties of the transition phases between fixations. We introduce hyperbolic geometry as a tool to measure the step length between consecutive eye positions. We show that the step lengths, measured in hyperbolic and euclidean geometry, follow a generalized Pareto distribution. The results based on the hyperbolic distance are more robust than those based on euclidean geometry. We show how the structure of the space of generalized Pareto distributions can be used to characterize and identify individual observers.
