Image Encryption Using Fibonacci-Lucas Transformation

Secret communication techniques are of great demand since last 3000 years due to the need of information security and confidentiality at various levels of communication such as while communicating confidential personal data, medical data of patients, defence and intelligence information of countries, data related to examinations etc. With advancements in image processing research, Image encryption and Steganographic techniques have gained popularity over other forms of hidden communication techniques during the last few decades and a number of image encryption models are suggested by various researchers from time to time. In this paper, we are suggesting a new image encryption model based on Fibonacci and Lucas series.
