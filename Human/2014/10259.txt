Particle Swarm Optimized Fuzzy Controller for Indirect Vector Control of Multilevel Inverter Fed Induction Motor

The Particle Swarm Optimized (PSO) fuzzy controller has been proposed for indirect vector control of induction motor. In this proposed scheme a Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) multilevel inverter is used and hysteresis current control technique has been adopted for switching the IGBTs. A Mamdani type fuzzy controller is used in place of conventional PI controller. To ensure better performance of fuzzy controller all parameters such as membership functions, normalizing and de-normalizing parameters are optimized using PSO. The performance of proposed controller is investigated under various load and speed conditions. The simulation results show its stability and robustness for high performance derives applications.
