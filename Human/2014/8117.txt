Algebraic and relational models for a system based on a poset of two elements

The aim of this paper is to present a very simple set of conditions, necessary for the management of knowledge of a poset $T$ of two agents, which are partially ordered by the capabilities available in the system. We build up a formal system and we elaborate suitable semantic models in order to derive information from the poset. The system is related to three-valued Heyting algebras with Boolean operators.
