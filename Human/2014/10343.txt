GUI system for Elders/Patients in Intensive Care

In the old age, few people need special care if they are suffering from specific diseases as they can get stroke while they are in normal life routine. Also patients of any age, who are not able to walk, need to be taken care of personally but for this, either they have to be in hospital or someone like nurse should be with them for better care. This is costly in terms of money and man power. A person is needed for 24x7 care of these people. To help in this aspect we purposes a vision based system which will take input from the patient and will provide information to the specified person, who is currently may not in the patient room. This will reduce the need of man power, also a continuous monitoring would not be needed. The system is using MS Kinect for gesture detection for better accuracy and this system can be installed at home or hospital easily. The system provides GUI for simple usage and gives visual and audio feedback to user. This system work on natural hand interaction and need no training before using and also no need to wear any glove or color strip.
