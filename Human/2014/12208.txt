Hypotheses of neural code and the information model of the neuron-detector

This paper deals with the problem of neural code solving. On the basis of the formulated hypotheses the information model of a neuron-detector is suggested, the detector being one of the basic elements of an artificial neural network (ANN). The paper subjects the connectionist paradigm of ANN building to criticism and suggests a new presentation paradigm for ANN building and neuroelements (NE) learning. The adequacy of the suggested model is proved by the fact that is does not contradict the modern propositions of neuropsychology and neurophysiology.
