Strongly Secure Quantum Ramp Secret Sharing Constructed from Algebraic Curves over Finite Fields

The first construction of strongly secure quantum ramp secret sharing by Zhang and Matsumoto had an undesirable feature that the dimension of quantum shares must be larger than the number of shares. By using algebraic curves over finite fields, we propose a new construction in which the number of shares can become arbitrarily large for fixed dimension of shares.
