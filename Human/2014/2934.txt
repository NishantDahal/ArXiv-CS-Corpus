Analyzing Large Biological Datasets with an Improved Algorithm for MIC

A computational framework utilizes the traditional similarity measures for mining the significant relationships in biological annotations is recently proposed by Tatiana V. Karpinets et al. [2]. In this paper, an improved approximation algorithm for MIC (maximal information coefficient) named IAMIC is suggested to perfect this framework for discovering the hidden regularities between biological annotations. Further, IAMIC is the enhanced algorithm for approximating a novel similarity coefficient MIC with generality and equitability, which makes it more appropriate for data exploration. Here it is shown that IAMIC is also applicable for identify the associations between biological annotations.
