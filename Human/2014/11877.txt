Covering numbers of $L_p$-balls of convex sets and functions

We prove bounds for the covering numbers of classes of convex functions and convex sets in Euclidean space. Previous results require the underlying convex functions or sets to be uniformly bounded. We relax this assumption and replace it with weaker integral constraints. Existing results can be recovered as special cases of our results.
