3D-Assisted Image Feature Synthesis for Novel Views of an Object

Comparing two images in a view-invariant way has been a challenging problem in computer vision for a long time, as visual features are not stable under large view point changes. In this paper, given a single input image of an object, we synthesize new features for other views of the same object. To accomplish this, we introduce an aligned set of 3D models in the same class as the input object image. Each 3D model is represented by a set of views, and we study the correlation of image patches between different views, seeking what we call surrogates --- patches in one view whose feature content predicts well the features of a patch in another view. In particular, for each patch in the novel desired view, we seek surrogates from the observed view of the given image. For a given surrogate, we predict that surrogate using linear combination of the corresponding patches of the 3D model views, learn the coefficients, and then transfer these coefficients on a per patch basis to synthesize the features of the patch in the novel view. In this way we can create feature sets for all views of the latent object, providing us a multi-view representation of the object. View-invariant object comparisons are achieved simply by computing the $L^2$ distances between the features of corresponding views. We provide theoretical and empirical analysis of the feature synthesis process, and evaluate the proposed view-agnostic distance (VAD) in fine-grained image retrieval (100 object classes) and classification tasks. Experimental results show that our synthesized features do enable view-independent comparison between images and perform significantly better than traditional image features in this respect.
