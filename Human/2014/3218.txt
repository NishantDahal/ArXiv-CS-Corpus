The Obvious Solution to Semantic Mapping -- Ask an Expert

The semantic mapping problem is probably the main obstacle to computer-to-computer communication. If computer A knows that its concept X is the same as computer B's concept Y, then the two machines can communicate. They will in effect be talking the same language. This paper describes a relatively straightforward way of enhancing the semantic descriptions of Web Service interfaces by using online sources of keyword definitions. Method interface descriptions can be enhanced using these standard dictionary definitions. Because the generated metadata is now standardised, this means that any other computer that has access to the same source, or understands standard language concepts, can now understand the description. This helps to remove a lot of the heterogeneity that would otherwise build up though humans creating their own descriptions independently of each other. The description comes in the form of an XML script that can be retrieved and read through the Web Service interface itself. An additional use for these scripts would be for adding descriptions in different languages, which would mean that human users that speak a different language would also understand what the service was about.
