Optimal Radio Resource Allocation for Hybrid Traffic in Cellular Networks: Centralized and Distributed Architecture

Optimal resource allocation is of paramount importance in utilizing the scarce radio spectrum efficiently and provisioning quality of service for miscellaneous user applications, generating hybrid data traffic streams in present-day wireless communications systems. A dynamism of the hybrid traffic stemmed from concurrently running mobile applications with temporally varying usage percentages in addition to subscriber priorities impelled from network providers' perspective necessitate resource allocation schemes assigning the spectrum to the applications accordingly and optimally. This manuscript concocts novel centralized and distributed radio resource allocation optimization problems for hybrid traffic-conveying cellular networks communicating users with simultaneously running multiple delay-tolerant and real-time applications modelled as logarithmic and sigmoidal utility functions, volatile application percent usages, and diverse subscriptions. Casting under a utility proportional fairness entail no lost calls for the proposed modi operandi, for which we substantiate the convexity, devise computationally efficient algorithms catering optimal rates to the applications, and prove a mutual mathematical equivalence. Ultimately, the algorithms performance is evaluated via simulations and discussing germane numerical results.
