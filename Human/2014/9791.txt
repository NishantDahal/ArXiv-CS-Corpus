Event Handling in ET++ - A Case Study in the Algebraic Specification of Object-Oriented Application Frameworks

In this report we investigate the suitability of algebraic specication techniques for the modular speci cation of complex object oriented systems As an example part of the event handling mechanism of the application framework ET is speci ed using a variant of the algebraic specication language Spectrum.
