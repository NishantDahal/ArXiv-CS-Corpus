The Hegselmann-Krause dynamics for equally spaced agents

We consider the Hegselmann-Krause bounded confidence dynamics for n equally spaced opinions on the real line, with gaps equal to the confidence bound r, which we take to be 1. We prove rigorous results on the evolution of this configuration, which confirm hypotheses previously made based on simulations for small values of n. Namely, for every n, the system evolves as follows: after every 5 time steps, a group of 3 agents become disconnected at either end and collapse to a cluster at the subsequent step. This continues until there are fewer than 6 agents left in the middle, and these finally collapse to a cluster, if n is not a multiple of 6. In particular, the final configuration consists of 2*[n/6] clusters of size 3, plus one cluster in the middle of size n (mod 6), if n is not a multiple of 6, and the number of time steps before freezing is 5n/6 + O(1). We also consider the dynamics for arbitrary, but constant, inter-agent spacings d \in [0, 1] and present three main findings. Firstly we prove that the evolution is periodic also at some other, but not all, values of d, and present numerical evidence that for all d something "close" to periodicity nevertheless holds. Secondly, we exhibit a value of d at which the behaviour is periodic and the time to freezing is n + O(1), hence slower than that for d = 1. Thirdly, we present numerical evidence that, as d --> 0, the time to freezing may be closer, in order of magnitude, to the diameter d(n-1) of the configuration rather than the number of agents n.
