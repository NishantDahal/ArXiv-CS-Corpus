Hidden Markov Model Based Part of Speech Tagger for Sinhala Language

In this paper we present a fundamental lexical semantics of Sinhala language and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based Part of Speech (POS) Tagger for Sinhala language. In any Natural Language processing task, Part of Speech is a very vital topic, which involves analysing of the construction, behaviour and the dynamics of the language, which the knowledge could utilized in computational linguistics analysis and automation applications. Though Sinhala is a morphologically rich and agglutinative language, in which words are inflected with various grammatical features, tagging is very essential for further analysis of the language. Our research is based on statistical based approach, in which the tagging process is done by computing the tag sequence probability and the word-likelihood probability from the given corpus, where the linguistic knowledge is automatically extracted from the annotated corpus. The current tagger could reach more than 90% of accuracy for known words.
