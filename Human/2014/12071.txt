Classification of digital n-manifolds

This paper presents the classification of digital n-manifolds based on the notion of complexity and homotopy equivalence. We introduce compressed n-manifolds and study their properties. We show that any n-manifold with p points is homotopy equivalent to a compressed n-manifold with m points, m<p. We design an algorithm for the classification of digital n-manifolds of any dimension n.
