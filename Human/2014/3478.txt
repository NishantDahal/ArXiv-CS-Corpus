The Structure and Quantum Capacity of a Partially Degradable Quantum Channel

The quantum capacity of degradable quantum channels has been proven to be additive. On the other hand, there is no general rule for the behavior of quantum capacity for non-degradable quantum channels. We introduce the set of partially degradable (PD) quantum channels to answer the question of additivity of quantum capacity for a well-separable subset of non-degradable channels. A quantum channel is partially degradable if the channel output can be used to simulate the degraded environment state. PD channels could exist both in the degradable, non-degradable and conjugate degradable family. We define the term partial simulation, which is a clear benefit that arises from the structure of the complementary channel of a PD channel. We prove that the quantum capacity of an arbitrary dimensional PD channel is additive. We also demonstrate that better quantum data rates can be achieved over a PD channel in comparison to standard (non-PD) channels. Our results indicate that the partial degradability property can be exploited and yet still hold many benefits for quantum communications.
