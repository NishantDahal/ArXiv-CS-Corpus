Spectral properties of cubic complex Pisot units

For a real number $β>1$, Erdős, Joó and Komornik study distances between consecutive points in the set $X^m(β)=\bigl\{\sum_{j=0}^n a_j β^j : n\in\mathbb N,\,a_j\in\{0,1,\dots,m\}\bigr\}$. Pisot numbers play a crucial role for the properties of $X^m(β)$. Following the work of Zaïmi, who considered $X^m(γ)$ with $γ\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\mathbb{R}$ and $|γ|>1$, we show that for any non-real $γ$ and $m < |γ|^2-1$, the set $X^m(γ)$ is not relatively dense in the complex plane.
  Then we focus on complex Pisot units with a positive real conjugate $γ'$ and $m > |γ|^2-1$. If the number $1/γ'$ satisfies Property (F), we deduce that $X^m(γ)$ is uniformly discrete and relatively dense, i.e., $X^m(γ)$ is a Delone set. Moreover, we present an algorithm for determining two parameters of the Delone set $X^m(γ)$ which are analogous to minimal and maximal distances in the real case $X^m(β)$. For $γ$ satisfying $γ^3 + γ^2 + γ- 1 = 0$, explicit formulas for the two parameters are given.
