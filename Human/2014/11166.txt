Rearrangement Problems with Duplicated Genomic Markers

Understanding the dynamics of genome rearrangements is a major issue of phylogenetics. Phylogenetics is the study of species evolution. A major goal of the field is to establish evolutionary relationships within groups of species, in order to infer the topology of an evolutionary tree formed by this group and common ancestors to some of these species. In this context, having means to evaluate relative evolutionary distances between species, or to infer common ancestor genomes to a group of species would be of great help. This work, in the vein of other studies from the past, aims at designing such means, here in the particular case where genomes present multiple occurrencies of genes, which makes things more complex. Several hypotheses accounting for the presence of duplications were considered. Distances formulae as well as scenario computing algorithms were established, along with their complexity proofs.
