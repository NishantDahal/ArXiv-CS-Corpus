Evaluation of the DiversiNews diversified news service

In this report we present the outcome of an extensive evaluation of the DiversiNews platform [8, 10] for diversified browsing of news, developed in the scope of the RENDER project. The evaluation was carried out along two main directions: a component evaluation, in which we assessed the maturity of the components underlying DiversiNews, and a user experience (UX) evaluation involving users of online news services. The results of the evaluation confirm the high value of DiversiNews as a novel paradigm for diversity-aware news browsing.
