Joint PIC and relay selection based on greedy techniques for cooperative DS-CDMA systems

In this work, we propose a cross-layer design strategy based on the parallel interference cancellation (PIC) detection technique and a multi-relay selection algorithm for the uplink of cooperative direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems. We devise a low-cost greedy list-based PIC (GL-PIC) strategy with RAKE receivers as the front-end that can approach the maximum likelihood detector performance. We also present a low-complexity multi-relay selection algorithm based on greedy techniques that can approach the performance of an exhaustive search. Simulations show an excellent bit error rate performance of the proposed detection and relay selection algorithms as compared to existing techniques.
