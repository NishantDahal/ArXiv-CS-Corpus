Annotating Video with Open Educational Resources in a Flipped Classroom Scenario

A wealth of Open Educational Resources is now available, and beyond the first and evident problem of finding them, the issue of articulating a set of resources is arising. When using audiovisual resources, among different possibilities, annotating a video resource with additional resources linked to specific fragments can constitute one of the articulation modalities. Annotating a video is a complex task, and in a pedagogical context, intermediary activities should be proposed in order to mitigate this complexity. In this paper, we describe a tool dedicated to supporting video annotation activities. It aims at improving learner engagement, by having students be more active when watching videos by offering a progressive annotation process, first guided by providing predefined resources, then more freely, to accompany users in the practice of annotating videos.
