Rapid increases in information technology also changed the existing markets and transformed them into e- markets (e-commerce) from physical markets. Equally with the e-commerce evolution, enterprises have to recover a safer approach for implementing E-commerce and maintaining its logical security. SOA is one of the best techniques to fulfill these requirements. SOA holds the vantage of being easy to use, flexible, and recyclable. With the advantages, SOA is also endowed with ease for message tampering and unauthorized access. This causes the security technology implementation of E-commerce very difficult at other engineering sciences. This paper discusses the importance of using SOA in E-commerce and identifies the flaws in the existing security analysis of E-commerce platforms. On the foundation of identifying defects, this editorial also suggested an implementation design of the logical security framework for SOA supported E-commerce system.
