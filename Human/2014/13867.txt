Towards Logical Architecture and Formal Analysis of Dependencies Between Services

This paper presents a formal approach to modelling and analysis of data and control flow dependencies between services within remotely deployed distributed systems of services. Our work aims at elaborating for a concrete system, which parts of the system (or system model) are necessary to check a given property. The approach allows services decomposition oriented towards efficient checking of system properties as well as analysis of dependencies within a system.
