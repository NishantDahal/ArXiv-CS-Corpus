A Framework for Practical Parallel Fast Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental computation in many scientific disciplines. In this paper, we show that novel fast matrix multiplication algorithms can significantly outperform vendor implementations of the classical algorithm and Strassen's fast algorithm on modest problem sizes and shapes. Furthermore, we show that the best choice of fast algorithm depends not only on the size of the matrices but also the shape. We develop a code generation tool to automatically implement multiple sequential and shared-memory parallel variants of each fast algorithm, including our novel parallelization scheme. This allows us to rapidly benchmark over 20 fast algorithms on several problem sizes. Furthermore, we discuss a number of practical implementation issues for these algorithms on shared-memory machines that can direct further research on making fast algorithms practical.
