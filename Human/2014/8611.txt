Chatbot for admissions

The communication of potential students with a university department is performed manually and it is a very time consuming procedure. The opportunity to communicate with on a one-to-one basis is highly valued. However with many hundreds of applications each year, one-to-one conversations are not feasible in most cases. The communication will require a member of academic staff to expend several hours to find suitable answers and contact each student. It would be useful to reduce his costs and time.
  The project aims to reduce the burden on the head of admissions, and potentially other users, by developing a convincing chatbot. A suitable algorithm must be devised to search through the set of data and find a potential answer. The program then replies to the user and provides a relevant web link if the user is not satisfied by the answer. Furthermore a web interface is provided for both users and an administrator.
  The achievements of the project can be summarised as follows. To prepare the background of the project a literature review was undertaken, together with an investigation of existing tools, and consultation with the head of admissions. The requirements of the system were established and a range of algorithms and tools were investigated, including keyword and template matching. An algorithm that combines keyword matching with string similarity has been developed. A usable system using the proposed algorithm has been implemented. The system was evaluated by keeping logs of questions and answers and by feedback received by potential students that used it.
