Quantum Random State Generation with Predefined Entanglement Constraint

Entanglement plays an important role in quantum communication, algorithms, and error correction. Schmidt coefficients are correlated to the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix. These eigenvalues are used in Von Neumann entropy to quantify the amount of the bipartite entanglement. In this paper, we map the Schmidt basis and the associated coefficients to quantum circuits to generate random quantum states. We also show that it is possible to adjust the entanglement between subsystems by changing the quantum gates corresponding to the Schmidt coefficients. In this manner, random quantum states with predefined bipartite entanglement amounts can be generated using random Schmidt basis. This provides a technique for generating equivalent quantum states for given weighted graph states, which are very useful in the study of entanglement, quantum computing, and quantum error correction.
