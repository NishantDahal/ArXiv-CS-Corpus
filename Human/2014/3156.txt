An Extensive Repot on the Efficiency of AIS-INMACA (A Novel Integrated MACA based Clonal Classifier for Protein Coding and Promoter Region Prediction)

This paper exclusively reports the efficiency of AIS-INMACA. AIS-INMACA has created good impact on solving major problems in bioinformatics like protein region identification and promoter region prediction with less time (Pokkuluri Kiran Sree, 2014). This AIS-INMACA is now came with several variations (Pokkuluri Kiran Sree, 2014) towards projecting it as a tool in bioinformatics for solving many problems in bioinformatics. So this paper will be very much useful for so many researchers who are working in the domain of bioinformatics with cellular automata.
