Force-Guiding Particle Chains for Shape-Shifting Displays

We present design and implementation of a chain of particles that can be programmed to fold the chain into a given curve. The particles guide an external force to fold, therefore the particles are simple and amenable for miniaturization. A chain can consist of a large number of such particles. Using multiple of these chains, a shape-shifting display can be constructed that folds its initially flat surface to approximate a given 3D shape that can be touched and modified by users, for example, enabling architects to interactively view, touch, and modify a 3D model of a building.
