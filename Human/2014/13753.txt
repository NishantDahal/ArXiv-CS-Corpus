Modeling Hybrid Systems in Hy-tccp

Concurrent,reactive and hybrid systems require quality modeling languages to be described and analyzed. The Timed Concurrent Constraint Language (tccp) was introduced as a simple but powerful model for reactive systems. In this paper, we present hybrid tccp (hy-tccp), an extension of tccp over continuous time which includes new con- structs to model the continuous dynamics of hybrid systems.
