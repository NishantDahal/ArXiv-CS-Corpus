A Security Plan for Smart Grid Systems Based On AGC4ISR

This paper is proposed a security plan for Smart Grid Systems based on AGC4ISR which is an architecture for Autonomic Grid Computing Systems. Smart Grid incorporates has many benefits of distributed computing and communications to deliver a real-time information and enable the near-instantaneous balance of supply and demand at the device level. AGC4ISR architecture is Organized by Autonomic Grid Computing and C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence, Surveillance, & Reconnaissance) Architecture. In this paper we will present a solution for as security plan which will be consider encryption, intrusion detection, key management and detail of cyber security in Smart Grids. In this paper we use the cryptography for the packet in the C4ISR and we use a key management for send and receive a packet in the smart grid because it is necessary for intelligent networks to keeping away from packet missing.
