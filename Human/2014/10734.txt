A General, Fast, and Robust Implementation of the Time-Optimal Path Parameterization Algorithm

Finding the Time-Optimal Parameterization of a given Path (TOPP) subject to kinodynamic constraints is an essential component in many robotic theories and applications. The objective of this article is to provide a general, fast and robust implementation of this component. For this, we give a complete solution to the issue of dynamic singularities, which are the main cause of failure in existing implementations. We then present an open-source implementation of the algorithm in C++/Python and demonstrate its robustness and speed in various robotics settings.
