Brachiaria species identification using imaging techniques based on fractal descriptors

The use of a rapid and accurate method in diagnosis and classification of species and/or cultivars of forage has practical relevance, scientific and trade in various areas of study. Thus, leaf samples of fodder plant species \textit{Brachiaria} were previously identified, collected and scanned to be treated by means of artificial vision to make the database and be used in subsequent classifications. Forage crops used were: \textit{Brachiaria decumbens} cv. IPEAN; \textit{Brachiaria ruziziensis} Germain \& Evrard; \textit{Brachiaria Brizantha} (Hochst. ex. A. Rich.) Stapf; \textit{Brachiaria arrecta} (Hack.) Stent. and \textit{Brachiaria spp}. The images were analyzed by the fractal descriptors method, where a set of measures are obtained from the values of the fractal dimension at different scales. Therefore such values are used as inputs for a state-of-the-art classifier, the Support Vector Machine, which finally discriminates the images according to the respective species.
