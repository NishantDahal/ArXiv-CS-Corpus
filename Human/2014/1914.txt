A Distributed Optimization Framework For Multi-channel Multi-user Small Cell Networks

Small cell enchantment is emerging as the key technique for wireless network evolution. One challenging problem for small cell enhancement is how to achieve high data rate with as-low-as-possible control and computation overheads. As a solution, we propose a low-complexity distributed optimization framework in this paper. Our solution includes two parts. One is a novel implicit information exchange mechanism that enables channel-aware opportunistic scheduling and resource allocation among links. The other is the sub-gradient based algorithm with a polynomial-time complexity. What is more, for large scale systems, we design an improved distributed algorithm based on insights obtained from the problem structure. This algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal performance with a much lower complexity. Our numerical evaluations validate the analytical results and show the advantage of our algorithms.
