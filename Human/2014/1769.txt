Evaluating ECG Capturing Using Sound-Card of PC/Laptop

The purpose of the Evaluating ECG capturing using sound-card of PC/Laptop is provided portable and low cost ECG monitoring system using laptop and mobile phones. There is no need to interface micro controller or any other device to transmit ECG data. This research is based on hardware design, implementation, signal capturing and Evaluation of an ECG processing and analyzing system which attend the physicians in heart disease diagnosis. Some important modification is given in design part to avoid all definitive ECG instrument problems faced in previous designs. Moreover, attenuate power frequency noise and noise that produces from patient's body have required additional developments. The hardware design has basically three units: transduction and conditioning Unit, interfacing unit and data processing unit.The most focusing factor is the ECG signal/data transmits in laptop/PC via microphone pin. The live simulation is possible using SOUNDSCOPE software in PC/Laptop. The software program that is written in MATLAB and LAB-View performs data acquisition (record, stored, filtration) and several tasks such as QRS detection, calculate heart rate.
