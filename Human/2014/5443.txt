Emulated ASIC Power and Temperature Monitor System for FPGA Prototyping of an Invasive MPSoC Computing Architecture

In this contribution the emulation of an ASIC temperature and power monitoring system (TPMon) for FPGA prototyping is presented and tested to control processor temperatures under different control targets and operating strategies. The approach for emulating the power monitor is based on an instruction-level energy model. For emulating the temperature monitor, a thermal RC model is used. The monitoring system supplies an invasive MPSoC computing architecture with hardware status information (power and temperature data of the processors within the system). These data are required for resource-aware load distribution. As a proof of concept different operating strategies and control targets were evaluated for a 2-tile invasive MPSoC computing system.
