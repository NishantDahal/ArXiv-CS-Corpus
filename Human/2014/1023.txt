Differentially Private Data Releasing for Smooth Queries with Synthetic Database Output

We consider accurately answering smooth queries while preserving differential privacy. A query is said to be $K$-smooth if it is specified by a function defined on $[-1,1]^d$ whose partial derivatives up to order $K$ are all bounded. We develop an $ε$-differentially private mechanism for the class of $K$-smooth queries. The major advantage of the algorithm is that it outputs a synthetic database. In real applications, a synthetic database output is appealing. Our mechanism achieves an accuracy of $O (n^{-\frac{K}{2d+K}}/ε)$, and runs in polynomial time. We also generalize the mechanism to preserve $(ε, δ)$-differential privacy with slightly improved accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the mechanisms have good accuracy and are efficient.
