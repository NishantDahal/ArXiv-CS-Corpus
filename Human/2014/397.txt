A Simple Software Application for Simulating Commercially Available Solar Panels

This article addresses the formulation and validation of a simple PC based software application developed for simulating commercially available solar panels. The important feature of this application is its capability to produce speedy results in the form of solar panel output characteristics at given environmental conditions by using minimal input data. Besides, it is able to deliver critical information about the maximum power point of the panel at a given environmental condition in quick succession. The application is based on a standard equation which governs solar panels and works by means of estimating unknown parameters in the equation to fit a given solar panel. The process of parameter estimation is described in detail with the aid of equations and data of a commercial solar panel. A validation of obtained results for commercial solar panels is also presented by comparing the panel manufacturers' results with the results generated by the application. In addition, implications of the obtained results are discussed along with possible improvements to the developed software application.
