Joint Optimization of Power Allocation and Training Duration for Uplink Multiuser MIMO Communications

In this paper, we consider a multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communication system between a base station equipped with multiple antennas and multiple mobile users each equipped with a single antenna. The uplink scenario is considered. The uplink channels are acquired by the base station through a training phase. Two linear processing schemes are considered, namely maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF). We optimize the training period and optimal training energy under the average and peak power constraint so that an achievable sum rate is maximized.
