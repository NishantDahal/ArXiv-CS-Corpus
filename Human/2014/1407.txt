Invisibility System Using Image Processing and Optical Camouflage Technology

Invisible persons are seen in fiction stories only, but in the real world it is proved that invisibility is possible. This paper describes the creation of invisibility with the help of technologies like Optical camouflage; Image based rendering and Retro reflective projection. The object that needs to be made transparent or invisible is painted or covered with retro reflective material. Then a projector projects the background image on it making the masking object virtually transparent. Capturing the background image requires a video camera, which sits behind the person wearing the cloak. The video from the camera must be in a digital format so it can be sent to a computer for image processing using image based rendering technical. There are some useful applications for this simple but astonishing technology.
