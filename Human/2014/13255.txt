Chinese Interpreting Studies: Genesis of a Discipline

The growth of Chinese Interpreting Studies (CIS) has been robust over the past two decades; this is reflected in the total number of research papers produced. This paper takes a scientometric approach to assessing the production, themes and theoretical influences of those papers over time. The most productive authors, universities, and regions, as well as patterns of research collaboration, were analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of the CIS landscape. This study reveals that the general culture of the discipline remained constant throughout the period, none of its theoretical influences or topics having gained significantly in popularity. However, certain limitations in the way research is conducted (lack of collaboration, inadequate academic policies, etc.) hinder its potential for future growth.
