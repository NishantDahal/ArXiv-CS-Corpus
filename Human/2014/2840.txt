Spelling Error Trends and Patterns in Sindhi

Statistical error Correction technique is the most accurate and widely used approach today, but for a language like Sindhi which is a low resourced language the trained corpora's are not available, so the statistical techniques are not possible at all. Instead a useful alternative would be to exploit various spelling error trends in Sindhi by using a Rule based approach. For designing such technique an essential prerequisite would be to study the various error patterns in a language. This pa per presents various studies of spelling error trends and their types in Sindhi Language. The research shows that the error trends common to all languages are also encountered in Sindhi but their do exist some error patters that are catered specifically to a Sindhi language.
