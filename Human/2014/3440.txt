Upcoming Standards in Wireless Local Area Networks

Network technologies are traditionally centered on wireline solutions. Wireless broadband technologies nowadays provide unlimited broadband usage to users that have been previously offered simply to wireline users. In this paper, we discuss some of the upcoming standards of one of the emerging wireless broadband technology i.e. IEEE 802.11. The newest and the emerging standards fix technology issues or add functionality that will be expected to overcome many of the current standing problems with IEEE 802.11.
