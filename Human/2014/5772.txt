Natural User Interfaces: Trend in Virtual Interaction

Based on the fundamental constraints of natural way of interacting such as speech, touch, contextual and environmental awareness,immersive 3D experiences-all with a goal of a computer that can see listen, learn talk and act. We drive a set of trends prevailing for the next generation of user interface: Natural User Interface (NUI).New technologies are pushing the boundaries of what is possible without touching or clicking an interface- paving the way of interaction to information visualization and opportunities in human towards more natural interaction than ever before. In this paper we consider the trends in computer interaction through that must be taken into consideration to come up-in the near future with a well-designed-NUI.
