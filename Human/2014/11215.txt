The Visualization of Change in Word Meaning over Time using Temporal Word Embeddings

We describe a visualization tool that can be used to view the change in meaning of words over time. The tool makes use of existing (static) word embedding datasets together with a timestamped $n$-gram corpus to create {\em temporal} word embeddings.
