Investigating SCADA Failures in Interdependent Critical Infrastructure Systems

This paper is based on the initial ideas of a PhD proposal which will investigate SCADA failures in physical infrastructure systems. The results will be used to develop a new notation to help risk assessment using dependable computing concepts. SCADA systems are widely used within critical infrastructures to perform system controls and deliver services to linked and dependent systems. Failures in SCADA systems will be investigated to help us understand and prevent cascading failures in future.
