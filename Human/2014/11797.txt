Offline Handwritten MODI Character Recognition Using HU, Zernike Moments and Zoning

HOCR is abbreviated as Handwritten Optical Character Recognition. HOCR is a process of recognition of different handwritten characters from a digital image of documents. Handwritten automatic character recognition has attracted many researchers all over the world to contribute handwritten character recognition domain. Shape identification and feature extraction is very important part of any character recognition system and success of method is highly dependent on selection of features. However feature extraction is the most important step in defining the shape of the character as precisely and as uniquely as possible. This is indeed the most important step and complex task as well and achieved success by using invariance property, irrespective of position and orientation. Zernike moments describes shape, identify rotation invariant due to its Orthogonality property. MODI is an ancient script of India had cursive and complex representation of characters. The work described in this paper presents efficiency of Zernike moments over Hu 7 moment with zoning for automatic recognition of handwritten MODI characters. Offline approach is used in this paper because MODI Script was very popular and widely used for writing purpose till 19th century before Devanagari was officially adopted.
