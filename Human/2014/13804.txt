Binary Log-Linear Learning with Stochastic Communication Links

In this paper, we consider distributed decision-making over stochastic communication links in multi-agent systems. We show how to extend the current literature on potential games with binary log-linear learning (which mainly focuses on ideal communication links) to consider the impact of stochastic communication channels. More specifically, we derive conditions on the probability of link connectivity to achieve a target probability for the set of potential maximizers (in the stationary distribution). Furthermore, our toy example demonstrates a transition phenomenon for achieving any target probability for the set of potential maximizers.
