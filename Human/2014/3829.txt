Previous Messages Provide the Key to Achieve Shannon Capacity in a Wiretap Channel

We consider a wiretap channel and use previously transmitted messages to generate a secret key which increases the secrecy capacity. This can be bootstrapped to increase the secrecy capacity to the Shannon capacity without using any feedback or extra channel while retaining the strong secrecy of the wiretap channel.
