Comparative Performance Analysis of Different Modulation Techniques for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signal

One of the most important multi-carrier transmission techniques used in the latest wireless communication arena is known as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). It has several characteristics such as providing greater immunity to multipath fading & impulse noise, eliminating Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) & Inter Carrier Interference (ICI) using a guard interval known as Cyclic Prefix (CP). A regular difficulty of OFDM signal is high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) which is defined as the ratio of the peak power to the average power of OFDM Signal. An improved design of amplitude clipping & filtering technique of us previously reduced significant amount of PAPR with slightly increase bit error rate (BER) compare to an existing method in case of Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) & Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). This paper investigates a comparative performance analysis of the different higher order modulation techniques on that design.
