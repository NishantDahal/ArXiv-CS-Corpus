Polarization as a novel architecture to boost the classical mismatched capacity of B-DMCs

We show that the mismatched capacity of binary discrete memoryless channels can be improved by channel combining and splitting via ArÄ±kan's polar transformations. We also show that the improvement is possible even if the transformed channels are decoded with a mismatched polar decoder.
