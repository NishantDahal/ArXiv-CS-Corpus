Limited Feedback-Based Interference Alignment for Interfering Multi-Access Channels

A limited feedback-based interference alignment (IA) scheme is proposed for the interfering multi-access channel (IMAC). By employing a novel performance-oriented quantization strategy, the proposed scheme is able to achieve the minimum overall residual inter-cell interference (ICI) with the optimized transceivers under limited feedback. Consequently, the scheme outperforms the existing counterparts in terms of system throughput. In addition, the proposed scheme can be implemented with flexible antenna configurations.
