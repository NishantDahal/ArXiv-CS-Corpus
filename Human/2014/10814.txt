A CMOS Tailed Tent Map for the Generation of Uniformly Distributed Chaotic Sequences

This paper describes the design of a modified tent map characterized by a uniform probability density function. The use of this map is proposed as an alternative to the tent map and the Bernoulli shift. It is shown that practical circuits implementing the latter two maps may possess parasitic stable equilibria, fact which would prevent the desired chaotic behavior of the system. On the other hand, commonly used strategies to avoid the parasitic equilibria onset also affect the uniformity of the probability density function. Conversely, the use of the proposed tailed tent map allows to assure a certain degree of parameter deviation robustness, without compromising on the statistical properties of the system.
