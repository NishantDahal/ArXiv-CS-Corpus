Efficiency Evaluation Metrics for Wireless Intelligent Sensors Applications

The metrology field has been progressed with the appearance of the wireless intelligent sensor systems providing more capabilities such as signal processing, remote multi-sensing fusion etc. This kind of devices is rapidly making their way into medical and industrial monitoring, collision avoidance, traffic control, automotive and others applications. However, numerous design challenges for wireless intelligent sensors systems are imposed to overcome the physical limitations in data traffic, such as system noise, real time communication, signal attenuation, response dynamics, power consumption, and effective conversion rates etc, especially for applications requiring specific performances. This paper analyzes the performance metrics of the mentioned sensing devices systems which stands for superior measurement, more accuracy and reliability. Study findings prescribe researchers, developers/ engineers and users to realizing an optimal sensing motes design strategy that offers operational advantages which can offer cost-effective solutions for an application.
