DinTucker: Scaling up Gaussian process models on multidimensional arrays with billions of elements

Infinite Tucker Decomposition (InfTucker) and random function prior models, as nonparametric Bayesian models on infinite exchangeable arrays, are more powerful models than widely-used multilinear factorization methods including Tucker and PARAFAC decomposition, (partly) due to their capability of modeling nonlinear relationships between array elements. Despite their great predictive performance and sound theoretical foundations, they cannot handle massive data due to a prohibitively high training time. To overcome this limitation, we present Distributed Infinite Tucker (DINTUCKER), a large-scale nonlinear tensor decomposition algorithm on MAPREDUCE. While maintaining the predictive accuracy of InfTucker, it is scalable on massive data. DINTUCKER is based on a new hierarchical Bayesian model that enables local training of InfTucker on subarrays and information integration from all local training results. We use distributed stochastic gradient descent, coupled with variational inference, to train this model. We apply DINTUCKER to multidimensional arrays with billions of elements from applications in the "Read the Web" project (Carlson et al., 2010) and in information security and compare it with the state-of-the-art large-scale tensor decomposition method, GigaTensor. On both datasets, DINTUCKER achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy with less computational time.
