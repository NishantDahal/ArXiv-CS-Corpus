The Design of a Network-On-Chip Architecture Based On An Avionic Protocol

When the Network-On-Chip (NoC) paradigm was introduced, many researchers have proposed many novelistic NoC architectures, tools and design strategies. In this paper we introduce a new approach in the field of designing Network-On-Chip (NoC). Our inspiration came from an avionic protocol which is the AFDX protocol. The proposed NoC architecture is a switch centric architecture, with exclusive shortcuts between hosts and utilizes the flexibility, the reliability and the performances offered by AFDX.
