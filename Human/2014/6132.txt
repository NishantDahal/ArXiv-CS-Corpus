A Wronskian Approach to the real τ-conjecture

According to the real τ-conjecture, the number of real roots of a sum of products of sparse polynomials should be polynomially bounded in the size of such an expression. It is known that this conjecture implies a superpolynomial lower bound on the arithmetic circuit complexity of the permanent.
  In this paper, we use the Wronksian determinant to give an upper bound on the number of real roots of sums of products of sparse polynomials. The proof technique is quite versatile; it can in particular be applied to some sparse geometric problems that do not originate from arithmetic circuit complexity. The paper should therefore be of interest to researchers from these two communities (complexity theory and sparse polynomial systems).
