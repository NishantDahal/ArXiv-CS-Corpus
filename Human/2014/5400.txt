An Adaptive Watermarking Process in Hadamard Transform

An adaptive visible/invisible watermarking scheme is done to prevent the privacy and preserving copyright protection of digital data using Hadamard transform based on the scaling factor of the image. The value of scaling factor depends on the control parameter. The scaling factor is calculated to embedded the watermark. Depend upon the control parameter the visible and invisible watermarking is determined. The proposed Hadamard transform domain method is more robust again image/signal processing attacks. Furthermore, it also shows that the proposed method confirm the efficiency through various performance analysis and experimental results.
