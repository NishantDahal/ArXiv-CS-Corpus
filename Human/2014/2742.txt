The state of play of ASC-Inclusion: An Integrated Internet-Based Environment for Social Inclusion of Children with Autism Spectrum Conditions

Individuals with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) have marked difficulties using verbal and non-verbal communication for social interaction. The running ASC-Inclusion project aims to help children with ASC by allowing them to learn how emotions can be expressed and recognised via playing games in a virtual world. The platform includes analysis of users' gestures, facial, and vocal expressions using standard microphone and web-cam or a depth sensor, training through games, text communication with peers, animation, video and audio clips. We present the state of play in realising such a serious game platform and provide results for the different modalities.
