Multilevel Diversity Coding Systems: Rate Regions, Codes, Computation, & Forbidden Minors

The rate regions of multilevel diversity coding systems (MDCS), a sub-class of the broader family of multi-source multi-sink networks with special structure, are investigated. After showing how to enumerate all non-isomorphic MDCS instances of a given size, the Shannon outer bound and several achievable inner bounds based on linear codes are given for the rate region of each non-isomorphic instance. For thousands of MDCS instances, the bounds match, and hence exact rate regions are proven. Results gained from these computations are summarized in key statistics involving aspects such as the sufficiency of scalar binary codes, the necessary size of vector binary codes, etc. Also, it is shown how to generate computer aided human readable converse proofs, as well as how to construct the codes for an achievability proof. Based on this large repository of rate regions, a series of results about general MDCS cases that they inspired are introduced and proved. In particular, a series of embedding operations that preserve the property of sufficiency of scalar or vector codes are presented. The utility of these operations is demonstrated by boiling the thousands of MDCS instances for which binary scalar codes are insufficient down to 12 forbidden smallest embedded MDCS instances.
