An landcover fuzzy logic classification by maximumlikelihood

In present days remote sensing is most used application in many sectors. This remote sensing uses different images like multispectral, hyper spectral or ultra spectral. The remote sensing image classification is one of the significant method to classify image. In this state we classify the maximum likelihood classification with fuzzy logic. In this we experimenting fuzzy logic like spatial, spectral texture methods in that different sub methods to be used for image classification.
