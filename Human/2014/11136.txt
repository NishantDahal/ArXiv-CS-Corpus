Investigation of A Collective Decision Making System of Different Neighbourhood-Size Based on Hyper-Geometric Distribution

The study of collective decision making system has become the central part of the Swarm- Intelligence Related research in recent years. The most challenging task of modelling a collec- tive decision making system is to develop the macroscopic stochastic equation from its microscopic model. In this report we have investigated the behaviour of a collective decision making system with specified microscopic rules that resemble the chemical reaction and used different group size. Then we ventured to derive a generalized analytical model of a collective-decision system using hyper-geometric distribution.
