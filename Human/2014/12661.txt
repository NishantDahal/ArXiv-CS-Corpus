Automata Describing Object Behavior

Relating formal re nement techniques with commercial object oriented software development methods is important to achieve enhancement of the power and exibility of these software development methods and tools. We will present an automata model together with a denotational and an operational semantics to describe the behavior of objects. Based on the given semantics we de ne a set of powerful re nement rules and discuss their applicability in software engineering practice especially with the use of inheritance.
