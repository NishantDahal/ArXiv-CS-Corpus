Sum Secrecy Rate in Full-Duplex Wiretap Channel with Imperfect CSI

In this paper, we consider the achievable sum secrecy rate in full-duplex wiretap channel in the presence of an eavesdropper and imperfect channel state information (CSI). We assume that the users participating in full-duplex communication and the eavesdropper have single antenna each. The users have individual transmit power constraints. They also transmit jamming signals to improve the secrecy rates. We obtain the achievable perfect secrecy rate region by maximizing the sum secrecy rate. We also obtain the corresponding optimum powers of the message signals and the jamming signals. Numerical results that show the impact of imperfect CSI on the achievable secrecy rate region are presented.
