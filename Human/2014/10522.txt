On approximate decidability of minimal programs

An index $e$ in a numbering of partial-recursive functions is called minimal if every lesser index computes a different function from $e$. Since the 1960's it has been known that, in any reasonable programming language, no effective procedure determines whether or not a given index is minimal. We investigate whether the task of determining minimal indices can be solved in an approximate sense. Our first question, regarding the set of minimal indices, is whether there exists an algorithm which can correctly label 1 out of $k$ indices as either minimal or non-minimal. Our second question, regarding the function which computes minimal indices, is whether one can compute a short list of candidate indices which includes a minimal index for a given program. We give some negative results and leave the possibility of positive results as open questions.
