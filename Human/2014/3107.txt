Hierarchical Recovery in Compressive Sensing

A combinatorial approach to compressive sensing based on a deterministic column replacement technique is proposed. Informally, it takes as input a pattern matrix and ingredient measurement matrices, and results in a larger measurement matrix by replacing elements of the pattern matrix with columns from the ingredient matrices. This hierarchical technique yields great flexibility in sparse signal recovery. Specifically, recovery for the resulting measurement matrix does not depend on any fixed algorithm but rather on the recovery scheme of each ingredient matrix. In this paper, we investigate certain trade-offs for signal recovery, considering the computational investment required. Coping with noise in signal recovery requires additional conditions, both on the pattern matrix and on the ingredient measurement matrices.
