Enhanced Out-of-Band Sensing Algorithm for Cognitive Radio Networks

In cognitive radio networks (CRN), Out-of-Band (OoB) spectrum sensing provides seamless communication. Cognitive radio (CR) users, so called secondary users (SUs), should avoid interference with primary users (PUs), the owner of the licensed band, while trying to access the unused licensed or unlicensed band, for spectrum utilization. When PUs request to access their band, SUs need to vacate the band, thus it is inconvenient to provide seamless communication without OoB sensing. In this paper, we suggest an OoB sensing algorithm to guarantee seamless communication and also minimize the interference of SUs on PUs. Also we obtain analysis-based achievable throughput by considering the OoB sensing duration. To verify our algorithm, we perform simulation and find that the effect due to OoB sensing on the aggregate throughput is insignificant.
