Combinatorial Search With Picat

Picat, a new member of the logic programming family, follows a different doctrine than Prolog in offering the core logic programming concepts: arrays and maps as built-in data types; implicit pattern matching with explicit unification and explicit non-determinism; functions for deterministic computations; and loops for convenient scripting and modeling purposes. Picat provides facilities for solving combinatorial search problems, including a common interface with CP, SAT, and MIP solvers, tabling for dynamic programming, and a module for planning. Picat's planner module, which is implemented by the use of tabling, has produced surprising and encouraging results. Thanks to term-sharing and resource-bounded tabled search, Picat overwhelmingly outperforms the cutting-edge ASP and PDDL planners on the planning benchmarks used in recent ASP competitions.
