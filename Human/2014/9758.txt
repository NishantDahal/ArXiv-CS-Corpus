Algorithms for Stochastic Games on Interference Channels

We consider a wireless channel shared by multiple transmitter-receiver pairs. Their transmissions interfere with each other. Each transmitter-receiver pair aims to maximize its long-term average transmission rate subject to an average power constraint. This scenario is modeled as a stochastic game. We provide sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium (NE). We then formulate the problem of finding NE as a variational inequality (VI) problem and present an algorithm to solve the VI using regularization. We also provide distributed algorithms to compute Pareto optimal solutions for the proposed game.
