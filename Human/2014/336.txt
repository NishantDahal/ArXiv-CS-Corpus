Peer Ratings in Massive Online Social Networks

Instant quality feedback in the form of online peer ratings is a prominent feature of modern massive online social networks (MOSNs). It allows network members to indicate their appreciation of a post, comment, photograph, etc. Some MOSNs support both positive and negative (signed) ratings. In this study, we rated 11 thousand MOSN member profiles and collected user responses to the ratings. MOSN users are very sensitive to peer ratings: 33% of the subjects visited the researcher's profile in response to rating, 21% also rated the researcher's profile picture, and 5% left a text comment. The grades left by the subjects are highly polarized: out of the six available grades, the most negative and the most positive are also the most popular. The grades fall into three almost equally sized categories: reciprocal, generous, and stingy. We proposed quantitative measures for generosity, reciprocity, and benevolence, and analyzed them with respect to the subjects' demographics.
