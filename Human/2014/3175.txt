Cyclic Orbit Codes and Stabilizer Subfields

Cyclic orbit codes are constant dimension subspace codes that arise as the orbit of a cyclic subgroup of the general linear group acting on subspaces in the given ambient space. With the aid of the largest subfield over which the given subspace is a vector space, the cardinality of the orbit code can be determined, and estimates for its distance can be found. This subfield is closely related to the stabilizer of the generating subspace. Finally, with a linkage construction larger, and longer, constant dimension codes can be derived from cyclic orbit codes without compromising the distance.
