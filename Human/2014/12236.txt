Correction to the 2005 paper: "Digit Selection for SRT Division and Square Root"

It has been pointed out by counterexamples in a 2013 paper in the IEEE Transactions on Computers [1], that there is an error in the previously ibid.\ in 2005 published paper [2] on the construction of valid digit selection tables for SRT type division and square root algorithms. The error has been corrected, and new results found on selection constants for maximally redundant digit sets.
