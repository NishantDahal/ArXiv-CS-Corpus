Accelerating the ANT Colony Optimization By Smart ANTs, Using Genetic Operator

This paper research review Ant colony optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), both are two powerful meta-heuristics. This paper explains some major defects of these two algorithm at first then proposes a new model for ACO in which, artificial ants use a quick genetic operator and accelerate their actions in selecting next state. Experimental results show that proposed hybrid algorithm is effective and its performance including speed and accuracy beats other version.
