Listen-and-Talk: Full-duplex Cognitive Radio Networks

In traditional cognitive radio networks, secondary users (SUs) typically access the spectrum of primary users (PUs) by a two-stage "listen-before-talk" (LBT) protocol, i.e., SUs sense the spectrum holes in the first stage before transmit in the second stage. In this paper, we propose a novel "listen-and-talk" (LAT) protocol with the help of the full-duplex (FD) technique that allows SUs to simultaneously sense and access the vacant spectrum. Analysis of sensing performance and SU's throughput are given for the proposed LAT protocol. And we find that due to self-interference caused by FD, increasing transmitting power of SUs does not always benefit to SU's throughput, which implies the existence of a power-throughput tradeoff. Besides, though the LAT protocol suffers from self-interference, it allows longer transmission time, while the performance of the traditional LBT protocol is limited by channel spatial correction and relatively shorter transmission period. To this end, we also present an adaptive scheme to improve SUs' throughput by switching between the LAT and LBT protocols. Numerical results are provided to verify the proposed methods and the theoretical results.
