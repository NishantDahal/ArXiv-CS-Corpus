On Formalisms for Dynamic Reconfiguration of Dependable Systems

Three formalisms of different kinds - VDM, Maude, and basic CCSdp - are evaluated for their suitability for the modelling and verification of dynamic software reconfiguration using as a case study the dynamic reconfiguration of a simple office workflow for order processing. The research is ongoing, and initial results are reported.
