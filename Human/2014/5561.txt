The Efficiency Examination of Teaching of Different Normalization Methods

Normalization is an important database design method, in the course of the teaching of data modeling the understanding and applying of this method cause problems for students the most. For improving the efficiency of learning normalization we looked for alternative normalization methods and introduced them into education. We made a survey among engineer students how efficient could they execute the normalization with different methods. We executed statistical and data mining examinations to decide whether any of the methods resulted significantly better solutions.
