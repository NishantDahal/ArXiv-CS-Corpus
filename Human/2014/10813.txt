A Simple Algorithm for Global Value Numbering

Global Value Numbering(GVN) is a method for detecting redundant computations in programs. Here, we introduce the problem of Global Value Numbering in its original form, as conceived by Kildall(1973), and present an algorithm which is a simpler variant of Kildall's. The algorithm uses the concept of value expression - an abstraction of a set of expressions - enabling a representation of the equivalence information which is compact and simple to manipulate.
