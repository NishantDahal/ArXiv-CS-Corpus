Draining our Glass: An Energy and Heat Characterization of Google Glass

The Google Glass is a mobile device designed to be worn as eyeglasses. This form factor enables new usage possibilities, such as hands-free video chats and instant web search. However, its shape also hampers its potential: (1) battery size, and therefore lifetime, is limited by a need for the device to be lightweight, and (2) high-power processing leads to significant heat, which should be limited, due to the Glass' compact form factor and close proximity to the user's skin. We use the Glass in a case study of the power and thermal characteristics of optical head-mounted display devices. We share insights and implications to limit power consumption to increase the safety and utility of head-mounted devices.
