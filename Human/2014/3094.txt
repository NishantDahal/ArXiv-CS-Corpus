Five Modular Redundancy with Mitigation Technique to Recover the Error Module

Hazard radiation can lead the system fault therefore Fault Tolerance is required. Fault Tolerant is a system, which is designed to keep operations running, despite the degradation in the specific module is happening. Many fault tolerances have been developed to handle the problem, to find the most robust and efficient in the possible technology. This paper will present the Five Modular Redundancy (FMR) with Mitigation Technique to Recover the Error Module. With Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration technology that have already available today, such fault tolerance technique can be implemented successfully. The project showed the robustness of the system is increased and module which is error can be recovered immediately.
