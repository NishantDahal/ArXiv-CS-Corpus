Support vector machine classification of dimensionally reduced structural MRI images for dementia

We classify very-mild to moderate dementia in patients (CDR ranging from 0 to 2) using a support vector machine classifier acting on dimensionally reduced feature set derived from MRI brain scans of the 416 subjects available in the OASIS-Brains dataset. We use image segmentation and principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Our resulting feature set contains 11 features for each subject. Performance of the classifiers is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Using linear and (gaussian) kernels, we obtain a training classification accuracy of 86.4% (90.1%), test accuracy of 85.0% (85.7%), test precision of 68.7% (68.5%), test recall of 68.0% (74.0%), and test Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.594 (0.616).
