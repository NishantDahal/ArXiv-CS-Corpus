Bounds for the modified eccentric connectivity index

The modified eccentric connectivity index of a graph is defined as the sum of the products of eccentricity with the total degree of neighboring vertices, over all vertices of the graph. This is a generalization of eccentric connectivity index. In this paper, we derive some upper and lower bounds for the modified eccentric connectivity index in terms of some graph parameters such as number of vertices, number of edges, radius, minimum degree, maximum degree, total eccentricity, the first and second Zagreb indices, Weiner index etc.
