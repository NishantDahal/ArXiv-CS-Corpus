A Review of Software Quality Models for the Evaluation of Software Products

Actually, software products are increasing in a fast way and are used in almost all activities of human life. Consequently measuring and evaluating the quality of a software product has become a critical task for many companies. Several models have been proposed to help diverse types of users with quality issues. The development of techniques for building software has influenced the creation of models to assess the quality. Since 2000 the construction of software started to depend on generated or manufactured components and gave rise to new challenges for assessing quality. These components introduce new concepts such as configurability, reusability, availability, better quality and lower cost. Consequently the models are classified in basic models which were developed until 2000, and those based on components called tailored quality models. The purpose of this article is to describe the main models with their strengths and point out some deficiencies. In this work, we conclude that in the present age, aspects of communications play an important factor in the quality of software
