Securing Medical Images by Watermarking Using DWT DCT and SVD

Telemedicine is well known application where enormous amount of medical data need to be transferred securely over network and manipulate effectively. Security of digital data, especially medical images, becomes important for many reasons such as confidentiality, authentication and integrity. Digital watermarking has emerged as a advanced technology to enhance the security of digital images. The insertion of watermark in medical images can authenticate it and guarantee its integrity. The watermark must be generally hidden does not affect the quality of the medical image. In this paper, we propose blind watermarking based on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we compare the performance of this technique with watermarking based DWT and SVD. The proposed method DWT, DCT and SVD comparatively better than DWT and SVD method.
