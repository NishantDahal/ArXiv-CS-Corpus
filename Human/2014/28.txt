Numerical application and Turbo C program using the Gauss-Jordan Method

The article presents the general notions and algorithm about the Gauss-Jordan method. An eloquent example is given and the Turbo C program illustrated this method. We conclude that we can obtain by this method the determinant, by simple calculations and reducing the rounding errors
