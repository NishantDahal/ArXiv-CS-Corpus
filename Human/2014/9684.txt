Real Time Fabric Defect Detection System on an Embedded DSP Platform

In industrial fabric productions, automated real time systems are needed to find out the minor defects. It will save the cost by not transporting defected products and also would help in making compmay image of quality fabrics by sending out only undefected products. A real time fabric defect detection system (FDDS), implementd on an embedded DSP platform is presented here. Textural features of fabric image are extracted based on gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). A sliding window technique is used for defect detection where window moves over the whole image computing a textural energy from the GLCM of the fabric image. The energy values are compared to a reference and the deviations beyond a threshold are reported as defects and also visually represented by a window. The implementation is carried out on a TI TMS320DM642 platform and programmed using code composer studio software. The real time output of this implementation was shown on a monitor.
