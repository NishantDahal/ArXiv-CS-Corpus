Glued trees algorithm under phase damping

We study the behaviour of the glued trees algorithm described by Childs et al. in [STOC `03, Proc. 35th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (2004) 59] under decoherence. We consider a discrete time reformulation of the continuous time quantum walk protocol and apply a phase damping channel to the coin state, investigating the effect of such a mechanism on the probability of the walker appearing on the target vertex of the graph. We pay particular attention to any potential advantage coming from the use of weak decoherence for the spreading of the walk across the glued trees graph.
