Customisable Handling of Java References in Prolog Programs

Integration techniques for combining programs written in distinct language paradigms facilitate the implementation of specialised modules in the best language for their task. In the case of Java-Prolog integration, a known problem is the proper representation of references to Java objects on the Prolog side. To solve it adequately, multiple dimensions should be considered, including reference representation, opacity of the representation, identity preservation, reference life span, and scope of the inter-language conversion policies. This paper presents an approach that addresses all these dimensions, generalising and building on existing representation patterns of foreign references in Prolog, and taking inspiration from similar inter-language representation techniques found in other domains. Our approach maximises portability by making few assumptions about the Prolog engine interacting with Java (e.g., embedded or executed as an external process). We validate our work by extending JPC, an open-source integration library, with features supporting our approach. Our JPC library is currently compatible with three different open source Prolog engines (SWI, YAP} and XSB) by means of drivers. To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).
