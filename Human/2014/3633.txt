A Smart Intelligent Way of Video Authentication Using Classification and Decomposition of Watermarking Methods

Video Watermarking serves as a new technology mainly used to provide security to the illegal distribution of digital video over the web. The purpose of any video watermarking scheme is to embed extra information into video in such a way that must be perceptually undetectable while still holding enough information in order to extract the watermark beginning with the resultant video. Information which is embedded within the original image is a Digital Watermark, which could be visible or invisible. To improved more security, embedding and extraction Watermark process should be complex against attackers. Recent research indicates SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) algorithms are employed owing to their simple scheme with mathematical function. In this proposed work an advanced SVD transformation algorithm is used for embedding and extraction process. Experimental results show proposed watermarking process is more secured than existing SVD approach.
