A Study on the Optimal Implementation of Statistical Multiplexing in DVB Distribution Systems

The paper presents an overview of the main methods used to improve the efficiency of DVB systems, based on multiplexing, through a study on the impact of the multiplexing methods used in DVB, having as a final goal a better usage of the data capacity and the possibility to insert new services into the original DVB Transport Stream. This study revealed that not all DVB providers are using statistical multiplexing. Based on this study, we were able to propose a method to improve the original DVB stream, originated from DVB-S or DVB-T providers. This method is proposing the detection of null packets, removal and reinserting a new service, with a VBR content. The method developed in this research can be implemented even in optimized statistical multiplexing systems, due to a residual use of null packets for data rate adjustment. There is no need to have access in the original stream multiplexer, since the method allows the implementation on the fly, near to the end user. The proposed method is proposed to be applied in DVB-S to DVB-C translation, using the computing power of a PC or in a FPGA implementation.
