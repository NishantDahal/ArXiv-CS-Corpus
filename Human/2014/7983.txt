Performance Estimation of 2*4 MIMO-MC-CDMA Using Convolution Code in Different Modulation Technique using ZF Detection Scheme

In this paper we estimate the performance of 2*4 MIMO-MC-CDMA system using convolution code in MATLAB which highly reduces BER. MC-CDMA (Multi Carrier Code Division for Multiple Access) is a multiuser and multiple access system which is formed by the combination of OFDM and CDMA and convolution encoding scheme is used in encoder of CDMA as FEC (Forward Error Correction) code to reduce BER (Bit Error Rate). MC-CDMA system is a multicarrier system in which single wideband frequency selective carrier is converted into parallel narrowband flat fading multiple sub-carriers to optimize the performance of system. Now this system further improved by combination of 2*4 MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) system which utilizes ZF (Zero Forcing) decoder at the receiver to reduce BER and also half rate convolutionally encoded Alamouti STBC (Space Time Block Code) block code as transmit diversity of MIMO for multiple transmission of data through multiple transmit antenna. Main advantage of using MIMO-MC-CDMA using convolution code is to reduce the complexity of system and to reduce BER with increased gain. In this paper we analyze system performance in different modulation schemes like, QPSK, 8PSK, 8QAM, 16QAM, 32QAM and 64QAM in Rayleigh fading channel using MATLAB.
