A Local Logic for Realizability in Web Service Choreographies

Web service choreographies specify conditions on observable interactions among the services. An important question in this regard is realizability: given a choreography C, does there exist a set of service implementations I that conform to C ? Further, if C is realizable, is there an algorithm to construct implementations in I ? We propose a local temporal logic in which choreographies can be specified, and for specifications in the logic, we solve the realizability problem by constructing service implementations (when they exist) as communicating automata. These are nondeterministic finite state automata with a coupling relation. We also report on an implementation of the realizability algorithm and discuss experimental results.
