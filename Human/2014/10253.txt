Parallel and Distributed Collaborative Filtering: A Survey

Collaborative filtering is amongst the most preferred techniques when implementing recommender systems. Recently, great interest has turned towards parallel and distributed implementations of collaborative filtering algorithms. This work is a survey of the parallel and distributed collaborative filtering implementations, aiming not only to provide a comprehensive presentation of the field's development, but also to offer future research orientation by highlighting the issues that need to be further developed.
