Footprint-Driven Locomotion Composition

One of the most efficient ways of generating goal-directed walking motions is synthesising the final motion based on footprints. Nevertheless, current implementations have not examined the generation of continuous motion based on footprints, where different behaviours can be generated automatically. Therefore, in this paper a flexible approach for footprint-driven locomotion composition is presented. The presented solution is based on the ability to generate footprint-driven locomotion, with flexible features like jumping, running, and stair stepping. In addition, the presented system examines the ability of generating the desired motion of the character based on predefined footprint patterns that determine which behaviour should be performed. Finally, it is examined the generation of transition patterns based on the velocity of the root and the number of footsteps required to achieve the target behaviour smoothly and naturally.
