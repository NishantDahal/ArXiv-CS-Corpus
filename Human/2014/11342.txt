Presence-absence reasoning for evolutionary phenotypes

Nearly invariably, phenotypes are reported in the scientific literature in meticulous detail, utilizing the full expressivity of natural language. Often it is particularly these detailed observations (facts) that are of interest, and thus specific to the research questions that motivated observing and reporting them. However, research aiming to synthesize or integrate phenotype data across many studies or even fields is often faced with the need to abstract from detailed observations so as to construct phenotypic concepts that are common across many datasets rather than specific to a few. Yet, observations or facts that would fall under such abstracted concepts are typically not directly asserted by the original authors, usually because they are "obvious" according to common domain knowledge, and thus asserting them would be deemed redundant by anyone with sufficient domain knowledge. For example, a phenotype describing the length of a manual digit for an organism implicitly means that the organism must have had a hand, and thus a forelimb; the presence or absence of a forelimb may have supporting data across a far wider range of taxa than the length of a particular manual digit. Here we describe how within the Phenoscape project we use a pipeline of OWL axiom generation and reasoning steps to infer taxon-specific presence/absence of anatomical entities from anatomical phenotypes. Although presence/absence is all but one, and a seemingly simple way to abstract phenotypes across data sources, it can nonetheless be powerful for linking genotype to phenotype, and it is particularly relevant for constructing synthetic morphological supermatrices for comparative analysis; in fact presence/absence is one of the prevailing character observation types in published character matrices.
