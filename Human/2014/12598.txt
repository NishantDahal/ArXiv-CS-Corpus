Enhanced Modulation Technique for Molecular Communication: OOMoSK

Molecular communication in nanonetworks is an emerging communication paradigm where molecules are used as information carriers. Concentration Shift Keying (CSK) and Molecule Shift Keying (MoSK) are being studied extensively for the short and medium range molecular nanonetworks. It is observed that MoSK outperforms CSK. However, MoSK requires different types of molecules for encoding which render transmitter and receiver complexities. We propose a modulation scheme called On-Off MoSK (OOMoSK) in which, molecules are released for information bit 1 and no molecule is released for 0. The proposed scheme enjoys reduced number of the types of molecules for encoding. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme enhances channel capacity and Symbol Error Rate (SER).
