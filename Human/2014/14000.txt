Resource control and intersection types: an intrinsic connection

In this paper we investigate the $λ$ -calculus, a $λ$-calculus enriched with resource control. Explicit control of resources is enabled by the presence of erasure and duplication operators, which correspond to thinning and con-traction rules in the type assignment system. We introduce directly the class of $λ$ -terms and we provide a new treatment of substitution by its decompo-sition into atomic steps. We propose an intersection type assignment system for $λ$ -calculus which makes a clear correspondence between three roles of variables and three kinds of intersection types. Finally, we provide the characterisation of strong normalisation in $λ$ -calculus by means of an in-tersection type assignment system. This process uses typeability of normal forms, redex subject expansion and reducibility method.
