A Majorization Order on Monomials and Termination of a Successive Difference Substitution Algorithm

We introduce a majorization order on monomials. With the help of this order, we derive a necessary condition on the positive termination of a general successive difference substitution algorithm (KSDS) for an input form $f$.
