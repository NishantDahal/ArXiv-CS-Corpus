Engineering Gesture-Based Authentication Systems

Gestures are a topic of increasing interest in authentication and successful implementation as a security layer requires reliable gesture recognition. So far much work focuses on new ways to recognize gestures, leaving discussion on the viability of recognition in an authentication scheme to the background.
  It is unclear how recognition should be deployed for practical and robust real-world authentication. In this article, we analyze the effectiveness of different approaches to recognizing gestures and the potential for use in secure gesture-based authentication systems.
