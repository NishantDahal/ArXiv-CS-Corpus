Is Fortran Still Relevant? Comparing Fortran with Java and C++

This paper presents a comparative study to evaluate and compare Fortran with the two most popular programming languages Java and C++. Fortran has gone through major and minor extensions in the years 2003 and 2008. (1) How much have these extensions made Fortran comparable to Java and C++? (2) What are the differences and similarities, in supporting features like: Templates, object constructors and destructors, abstract data types and dynamic binding? These are the main questions we are trying to answer in this study. An object-oriented ray tracing application is implemented in these three languages to compare them. By using only one program we ensured there was only one set of requirements thus making the comparison homogeneous. Based on our literature survey this is the first study carried out to compare these languages by applying software metrics to the ray tracing application and comparing these results with the similarities and differences found in practice. We motivate the language implementers and compiler developers, by providing binary analysis and profiling of the application, to improve Fortran object handling and processing, and hence making it more prolific and general. This study facilitates and encourages the reader to further explore, study and use these languages more effectively and productively, especially Fortran.
