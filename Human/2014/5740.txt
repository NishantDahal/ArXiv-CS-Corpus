Symmetric Algorithm Survey: A Comparative Analysis

Information Security has become an important issue in modern world as the popularity and infiltration of internet commerce and communication technologies has emerged, making them a prospective medium to the security threats. To surmount these security threats modern data communications uses cryptography an effective, efficient and essential component for secure transmission of information by implementing security parameter counting Confidentiality, Authentication, accountability, and accuracy. To achieve data security different cryptographic algorithms (Symmetric & Asymmetric) are used that jumbles data in to scribbled format that can only be reversed by the user that have to desire key. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of different existing cryptographic algorithms (symmetric) based on their Architecture, Scalability, Flexibility, Reliability, Security and Limitation that are essential for secure communication (Wired or Wireless).
