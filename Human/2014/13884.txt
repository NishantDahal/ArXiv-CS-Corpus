Optimization of Software Quality Using Management and Technical Review Techniques

Optimizing the quality of software is a function of the degree of reviews made during the early life of a software development process. Reviews detect errors and potential errors early in the software development process. The errors detected during the early life cycle of software are least expensive to correct. Efficient involvement in software inspections and technical reviews, help developers improve their own skills, thereby mitigating the occurrence of errors in the later stage of software development process. The ideas gathered on this paper point that a properly implemented program of technical and management reviews drastically reduces the time as well as the cost required for testing, debugging, and reworking, and dramatically improves the quality of the resulting product. This paper, Optimization of Software Quality using management and technical Review Techniques, provides its readers with the opportunity to learn about and experience using this indispensable software quality tools.
