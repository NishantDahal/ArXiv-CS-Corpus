Establishing an Online Access Panel for Interactive Information Retrieval Research

We propose an online access panel to support the evaluation process of Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) systems - called IIRpanel. By maintaining an online access panel with users of IIR systems we assume that the recurring effort to recruit participants for web-based as well as for lab studies can be minimized. We target on using the online access panel not only for our own development processes but to open it for other interested researchers in the field of IIR. In this paper we present the concept of IIRpanel as well as first implementation details.
