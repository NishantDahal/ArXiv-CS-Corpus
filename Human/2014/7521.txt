On number of nonzero cells in some two-dimensional reversible second-order cellular automata

Recursive equations for the number of cells with nonzero values at $n$-th step for some two-dimensional reversible second-order cellular automata are proved in this work. Initial configuration is a single cell with the value one and all others zero.
