A Noble Methodology for Users Work Process Driven Software Requirements for Smart Handheld Devices

Requirement engineering is a key ingredient for software development to be effective. Apart from the traditional software requirement which is not much appropriate for new emerging software such as smart handheld device based software. In many perspectives of requirement engineering, traditional and new emerging software are not similar. Whereas requirement engineering of traditional software needs more research, it is obvious that new emerging software needs methodically and in-depth research for improved productivity, quality, risk management and validity. In particular, the result of this paper shows that how effective requirement engineering can improve in project negotiation, project planning, managing feature creep, testing, defect, rework and product quality. This paper also shows a new methodology which is focused on users work process applicable for eliciting the requirement of traditional software and any new type software of smart handheld device such as iPad. As an example, the paper shows how the methodology will be applied as a software requirement of iPad-based software for play-group students.
