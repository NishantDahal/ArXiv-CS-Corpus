Efficient Codes for Adversarial Wiretap Channels

In [13] we proposed a (ρ_r , ρ_w )-adversarial wiretap channel model (AWTP) in which the adversary can adaptively choose to see a fraction ρ_r of the codeword sent over the channel, and modify a fraction ρ_w of the codeword by adding arbitrary noise values to them. In this paper we give the first efficient construction of a capacity achieving code family that provides perfect secrecy for this channel.
