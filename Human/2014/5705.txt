NetSecCC: A Scalable and Fault-tolerant Architecture without Outsourcing Cloud Network Security

Modern cloud computing platforms based on virtual machine monitors carry a variety of complex business that present many network security vulnerabilities. At present, the traditional architecture employs a number of security devices at front-end of cloud computing to protect its network security. Under the new environment, however, this approach can not meet the needs of cloud security. New cloud security vendors and academia also made great efforts to solve network security of cloud computing, unfortunately, they also cannot provide a perfect and effective method to solve this problem. We introduce a novel network security architecture for cloud computing (NetSecCC) that addresses this problem. NetSecCC not only provides an effective solution for network security issues of cloud computing, but also greatly improves in scalability, fault-tolerant, resource utilization, etc. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype about NetSecCC and proved by experiments that NetSecCC is an effective architecture with minimal performance overhead that can be applied to the extensive practical promotion in cloud computing.
