Accelerated Approximation of the Complex Roots of a Univariate Polynomial (Extended Abstract)

Highly efficient and even nearly optimal algorithms have been developed for the classical problem of univariate polynomial root-finding (see, e.g., \cite{P95}, \cite{P02}, \cite{MNP13}, and the bibliography therein), but this is still an area of active research. By combining some powerful techniques developed in this area we devise new nearly optimal algorithms, whose substantial merit is their simplicity, important for the implementation.
