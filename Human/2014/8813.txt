Asymptotic bounds on the equilateral dimension of hypercubes

A subset of the finite dimensional hypercube is said to be equilateral if the distance of any two distinct points equals a fixed value. The equilateral dimension of the hypercube is defined as the maximal size of its equilateral subsets. We study asymptotic bounds on the latter quantity considered as a function of two variables, namely dimension and distance.
