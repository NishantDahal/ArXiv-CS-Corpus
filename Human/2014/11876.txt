A Fast Minimal Infrequent Itemset Mining Algorithm

A novel fast algorithm for finding quasi identifiers in large datasets is presented. Performance measurements on a broad range of datasets demonstrate substantial reductions in run-time relative to the state of the art and the scalability of the algorithm to realistically-sized datasets up to several million records.
