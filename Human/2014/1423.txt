Classifying the Clique-Width of $H$-Free Bipartite Graphs

Let $G$ be a bipartite graph, and let $H$ be a bipartite graph with a fixed bipartition $(B_H,W_H)$. We consider three different, natural ways of forbidding $H$ as an induced subgraph in $G$. First, $G$ is $H$-free if it does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. Second, $G$ is strongly $H$-free if $G$ is $H$-free or else has no bipartition $(B_G,W_G)$ with $B_H\subseteq B_G$ and $W_H\subseteq W_G$. Third, $G$ is weakly $H$-free if $G$ is $H$-free or else has at least one bipartition $(B_G,W_G)$ with $B_H\not\subseteq B_G$ or $W_H\not\subseteq W_G$. Lozin and Volz characterized all bipartite graphs $H$ for which the class of strongly $H$-free bipartite graphs has bounded clique-width. We extend their result by giving complete classifications for the other two variants of $H$-freeness.
