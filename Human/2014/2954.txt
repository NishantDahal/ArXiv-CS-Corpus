Optimal number of users in Co-operative spectrum sensing in WRAN using Cyclo-Stationary Detector

Cognitive radio allows unlicensed users to access licensed frequency bands through dynamic spectrum access so as to reduce spectrum scarcity. This requires intelligent spectrum sensing techniques. This paper investigates the use of cyclo-stationary detector and performance evaluation for Digital Video Broadcast-Terrestrial (DVB-T) signals. Generally, DVB-T is specified in IEEE 802.22 standard in VHF and UHF TV broadcasting spectrum. Simulations results show that implementing co-operative spectrum sensing help in better utilization of resources. The paper further proposes to find number of optimal users in a scenario to optimize the detection probability and makes use of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique to find an optimum value of threshold.
