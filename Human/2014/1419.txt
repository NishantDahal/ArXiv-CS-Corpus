Double Cylinder Cycle codes of Arbitrary Girth

A particular class of low-density parity-check codes referred to as cylinder-type BC-LDPC codes is proposed by Gholami and Eesmaeili. In this paper We represent a double cylinder-type parity-check matrix H by a graph called the block-structure graph of H and denoted by BSG(H). Using the properties of BSG(H) we propose some mother matrices with column-weight two such that the rate of corresponding cycle codes are greater tan cycle codes constructed by Gholami with same girth.
