Distributed Storage Systems based on Equidistant Subspace Codes

Distributed storage systems based on equidistant constant dimension codes are presented. These equidistant codes are based on the Pl√ºcker embedding, which is essential in the repair and the reconstruction algorithms. These systems posses several useful properties such as high failure resilience, minimum bandwidth, low storage, simple algebraic repair and reconstruction algorithms, good locality, and compatibility with small fields.
