Towards Cross-layer Reliability Analysis of Transient and Permanent Faults

Due to the increasing complexity of Multi-Processor Systems on Chip (MPSoCs), system-level design methodologies have got a lot of attention in recent years. However, the significant gap between the system-level reliability analysis and the level where the actual faults occur necessitates a cross-layer approach in which the sufficient data about the effects of faults at low levels are passed to the system level. So far, the cross-layer reliability analysis techniques focus on a specific type of faults, e.g., either permanent or transient faults. In this work, we aim at proposing a cross-layer reliability analysis which considers different fault types concurrently and connects reliability analysis techniques at different levels of abstraction using adapters.
