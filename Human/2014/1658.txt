Breaking Barriers: Assistive Technology Tool as Educational Software to support Writing

The preliminary report by Siriraj Hospital suggested that 6% of population who are students in Thailand could be estimated to have learning disabilities. It is therefore necessary for our institute to develop suitable ICT technologies to assist the education of these learning disabilities children. We therefore developed a program called Thai Word Prediction Program. Thai Word Prediction program aims to assist students with learning disabilities in their writing. After the usability engineering, we conducted the experiment with students with learning disabilities at the School in Bangkok. Hence, the results indicated that all three students with learning disabilities in this study improved their ability of writing by 50%, 81.89% and 100% respectively.
