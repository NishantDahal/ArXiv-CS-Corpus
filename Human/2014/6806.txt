Perceptual Quality of Video with Periodic Frame Rate and Quantization Variation-Subjective Studies and Analytical Modeling

In networked video applications, the frame rate (FR) and quantization stepsize (QS) of a compressed video are often adapted in response to the changes of the available bandwidth. It is important to understand how do the variation of FR and QS and their variation pattern affect the video quality. In this paper, we investigate the impact of temporal variation of FR and QS on the perceptual video quality. Among all possible variation patterns, we focus on videos in which two FR's (or QS's) alternate over a fixed interval. We explore the human responses to such variation by conducting subjective evaluation of test videos with different variation magnitudes and frequencies. We further analyze statistical significance of the impact of variation magnitude, variation frequency, video content, and their interactions. By analyzing the subjective ratings, we propose two models for predicting the quality of video with alternating FR and QS, respectively, The proposed models have simple mathematical forms with a few content-dependent parameters. The models fit the measured data very well using parameters determined by least square fitting with the measured data. We further propose some guidelines for adaptation of FR and QS based on trends observed from subjective test results.
