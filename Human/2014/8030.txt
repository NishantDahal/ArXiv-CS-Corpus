A Novel Spectrally-Efficient Scheme for Physical Layer Network Coding

In this paper, we propose a novel three-time-slot transmission scheme combined with an efficient embedded linear channel equalization (ELCE) technique for the Physical layer Network Coding (PNC). Our transmission scheme, we achieve about 33% increase in the spectral efficiency over the conventional two-time-slot scheme while maintaining the same end-toend BER performance.We derive an exact expression for the endto- end BER of the proposed three-time-slot transmission scheme combined with the proposed ELCE technique for BPSK transmission. Numerical results demonstrate that the exact expression for the end-to-end BER is consistent with the BER simulation results.
