Collaborative learning model with virtual team in ubiquitous learning environment using creative problem solving process

The purposes of this research study were: 1) to develop a Collaborative Learning Model with Virtual Team in u-Learning Environment using Creative Problem-solving Process(U-CCPS Model); 2) to evaluate a U-CCPS Model. The research procedures were divided into two phases. The first phase was to develop U-CCPS Model, and the second phase was to evaluate U-CCPS Model. The sample group in this study consisted of five experts using purposive sampling. Data were analyzed by arithmetic mean and standard deviation. The research findings were as follows: The U-CCPS learning Model consisted of five components as follows: 1) Input factors, 2) Process, 3) Control, 4) Output and 5) Feedback. The input factors consisted of four components as followed: 1) Objectives of U-CCPS Model, 2) Roles of Instructors, 3) Roles of learners and 4) Design of learning media. The process consisted of two components as followed: 1) Preparation before learning, and 2) Instructional management process. The experts agree that a U-CCPS Model was highest suitability.
