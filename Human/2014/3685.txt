Unit verification procedure as a test of real time messaging-based processes

The article presents the first results of a PhD study connected to testing of safety critical medical devices: a systematically executed case study at a Hungarian manufacturer of medical devices. The article shortly describes the process of testing currently being used. Elements of the testing approach less commonly applied in software industry are emphasized . The ending point of the actual testing process in the case study is the starting point for further research: the automated analysis of the testing results. The author started to develop a new approach, using a combination of tools, and modeling a model-based test generating tool - something that is both novel and intensive as an area of research.
