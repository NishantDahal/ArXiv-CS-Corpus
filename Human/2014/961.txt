Tendencies, Dead-ends, and Promising Ways. From Interface Ideas to New Programs

The mechanism of communication between users and devices is called interface. From time to time changes in interface significantly improve our work with computers even without any serious changes in programs themselves. Main ideas in PCs interface were introduced many years ago and since then there are no significant changes, while new devices show promising ways by using direct manipulation of screen objects. Users' direct action with all the screen objects of our ordinary PCs turns standard screens into touch screens of very high resolution and not only changes the interface of familiar programs but creates the new type of programs: user-driven applications.
