Mobile Agents for Distance Evaluation Procedures

The growth of Internet has led to new approaches for distance education. The main mechanisms involved in this process are distance learning and distance evaluation. Distance learning have multiple forms, from browsing and finding information when needed or collecting information onto ready-to-use packages, to interactive content where the learner is able to affect and control the content in some way. From the teacher's point of view, evaluation of learning aims to determine whether the students have achieved the goals set for a particular topic or course. Typically this is tested somehow and based on the test results, evaluation is performed. This kind of method is always restricted to the test, however. Many times the students may actually learn something completely different from those that are tested. Furthermore, testing does not necessarily take the students' individual needs into account. However, when properly designed, the testing method is a practical and even fairly reliable way of evaluating learning.
