Steerable Antennas for Automotive Communication Systems

This research project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of RF beamforming techniques for design, simulation, fabrication, and measurement of Butler Matrix and Rotman Lens beamforming networks. It is aimed to develop novel and well-established designs for steerable antenna systems that can be used in vehicular telematics and automotive communication systems based on microwave and millimeter-wave techniques.
