Permutation Trellis Coded Multi-level FSK Signaling to Mitigate Primary User Interference in Cognitive Radio Networks

We employ Permutation Trellis Code (PTC) based multi-level Frequency Shift Keying signaling to mitigate the impact of Primary Users (PUs) on the performance of Secondary Users (SUs) in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs). The PUs are assumed to be dynamic in that they appear intermittently and stay active for an unknown duration. Our approach is based on the use of PTC combined with multi-level FSK modulation so that an SU can improve its data rate by increasing its transmission bandwidth while operating at low power and not creating destructive interference for PUs. We evaluate system performance by obtaining an approximation for the actual Bit Error Rate (BER) using properties of the Viterbi decoder and carry out a thorough performance analysis in terms of BER and throughput. The results show that the proposed coded system achieves i) robustness by ensuring that SUs have stable throughput in the presence of heavy PU interference and ii) improved resiliency of SU links to interference in the presence of multiple dynamic PUs.
