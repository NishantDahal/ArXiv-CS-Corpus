Who negatively influences me? Formalizing diffusion dynamics of negative exposure leading to student attrition in MOOCs

In this work, we explain the underlying interaction mechanisms which govern students' influence on each other in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Specifically, we outline different ways in which students can be negatively exposed to their peers on MOOC forums and discuss a simple formulation of learning network diffusion, which formalizes the essence of how such an influence spreads and can potentially lead to student attrition over time. We also view the limitations of our student modeling in the light of real world MOOC behavior and consequently suggest ways of extending the diffusion model to handle more complex assumptions. Such an understanding is very beneficial for MOOC designers and instructors to create a conducive learning environment that supports students' growth and increases their engagement in the course.
