Multiparty Sessions based on Proof Nets

We interpret Linear Logic Proof Nets in a term language based on Solos calculus.  The system includes a synchronisation mechanism, obtained by a conservative extension of the logic,  that enables to define non-deterministic behaviours and multiparty sessions.
