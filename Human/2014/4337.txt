Fast Sequential Summation Algorithms Using Augmented Data Structures

This paper provides an introduction to the design of augmented data structures that offer an efficient representation of a mathematical sequence and fast sequential summation algorithms, which guarantee both logarithmic running time and logarithmic computational cost in terms of the total number of operations. In parallel summation algorithms, logarithmic running time is achieved by high linear computational cost with a linear number of processors. The important practical advantage of the fast sequential summation algorithms is that they do not require supercomputers and can run on the cheapest single processor systems.
