An Overview of Face Liveness Detection

Face recognition is a widely used biometric approach. Face recognition technology has developed rapidly in recent years and it is more direct, user friendly and convenient compared to other methods. But face recognition systems are vulnerable to spoof attacks made by non-real faces. It is an easy way to spoof face recognition systems by facial pictures such as portrait photographs. A secure system needs Liveness detection in order to guard against such spoofing. In this work, face liveness detection approaches are categorized based on the various types techniques used for liveness detection. This categorization helps understanding different spoof attacks scenarios and their relation to the developed solutions. A review of the latest works regarding face liveness detection works is presented. The main aim is to provide a simple path for the future development of novel and more secured face liveness detection approach.
