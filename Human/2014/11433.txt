Linear Precoding for the MIMO Multiple Access Channel with Finite Alphabet Inputs and Statistical CSI

In this paper, we investigate the design of linear precoders for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access channel (MAC). We assume that statistical channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitters and consider the problem under the practical finite alphabet input assumption. First, we derive an asymptotic (in the large system limit) expression for the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the MIMO MAC with finite alphabet inputs and Weichselberger's MIMO channel model. Subsequently, we obtain the optimal structures of the linear precoders of the users maximizing the asymptotic WSR and an iterative algorithm for determining the precoders. We show that the complexity of the proposed precoder design is significantly lower than that of MIMO MAC precoders designed for finite alphabet inputs and instantaneous CSI. Simulation results for finite alphabet signalling indicate that the proposed precoder achieves significant performance gains over existing precoder designs.
