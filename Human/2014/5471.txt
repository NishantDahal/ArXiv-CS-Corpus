Reversible and Irreversible Data Hiding Technique

Steganography (literally meaning covered writing) is the art and science of embedding secret message into seemingly harmless message. Stenography is practice from olden days where in ancient Greece people used wooden blocks to inscribe secret data and cover the date with wax and write normal message on it. Today stenography is used in various field like multimedia, networks, medical, military etc. With increasing technology trends steganography is becoming more and more advanced where people not only interested on hiding messages in multimedia data (cover data) but also at the receiving end they are willing to obtain original cover data without any distortion after extracting secret message. This paper will discuss few irreversible data hiding techniques and also, some recently proposed reversible data hiding approach using images.
