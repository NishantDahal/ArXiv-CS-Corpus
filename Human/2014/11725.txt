Optimal Ternary Constant-Composition Codes with Weight Four and Distance Six

The sizes of optimal constant-composition codes of weight three have been determined by Chee, Ge and Ling with four cases in doubt. Group divisible codes played an important role in their constructions. In this paper, we study the problem of constructing optimal ternary constant-composition codes with Hamming weight four and minimum distance six. The problem is solved with a small number of lengths undetermined. The previously known results are those with code length no greater than 10.
