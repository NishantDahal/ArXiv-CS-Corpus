On Intersecting IFS Fractals with Lines

IFS fractals - the attractors of Iterated Function Systems - have motivated plenty of research to date, partly due to their simplicity and applicability in various fields, such as the modeling of plants in computer graphics, and the design of fractal antennas. The statement and resolution of the Fractal-Line Intersection Problem is imperative for a more efficient treatment of certain applications. This paper intends to take further steps towards this resolution, building on the literature. For the broad class of hyperdense fractals, a verifiable condition guaranteeing intersection with any line passing through the convex hull of a planar IFS fractal is shown, in general R^d for hyperplanes. The condition also implies a constructive algorithm for finding the points of intersection. Under certain conditions, an infinite number of approximate intersections are guaranteed, if there is at least one. Quantification of the intersection is done via an explicit formula for the invariant measure of IFS.
