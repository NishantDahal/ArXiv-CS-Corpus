MontiWeb - Modular Development of Web Information Systems

The development process of web information systems is often tedious, error prone and usually involves redundant steps of work. Therefore, it is rather e_x000E_fficient to employ a modeldriven approach for the systematic aspects that comprise such a system. This involves models for the data structure that shall be handled by the system (here: class diagrams), various editable and read-only presentations (views) on combinations and extractions of the underlying data (here: a special view language) and ways to connect these views and define data flow between them (here: activity diagrams). In this paper, we present the MontiWeb approach to model and generate these aspects in a modular manner by incorperating the MontiCore framework. Therefor we shortly introduce the infrastructure that helps to develop modular systems. This involves the whole development process from defining the modeling languages to final code generation as well as all steps in between. We present the text-based class and activity diagram languages as well as a view language that are used to model our system.
