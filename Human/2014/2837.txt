An Inter-Component Pixels Permutation Based Color Image Encryption Using Hyper-chaos

In this paper, a simple and robust color image encryption algorithm based on high-dimensional chaotic maps is proposed. The algorithm employs a 3D Arnold transform to perform inter-component shuffling of plain-image, while a 2D hyper-chaotic map is used to confuse the relationship between the encrypted image and plain-image. The control parameters of Arnold transform are extracted from pending plain-image, thereby establishing a dependency to the plain-image. The confusion process is carried out in cipher-block chaining mode to make it dependent to the encrypted image. This makes the algorithm able to resist the cryptographic attacks. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed through computer simulations. The experimental analyses show that the proposed algorithm has desirable properties of high security, robustness to cryptographic attacks and practicability to protect multimedia color images.
