Planar Shielded-Loop Resonators

The design and analysis of planar shielded-loop resonators for use in wireless non-radiative power transfer systems is presented. The difficulties associated with coaxial shielded-loop resonators for wireless power transfer are discussed and planar alternatives are proposed. The currents along these planar structures are analyzed and first-order design equations are presented in the form of a circuit model. In addition, the planar structures are simulated and fabricated. Planar shielded-loop resonators are compact and simple to fabricate. Moreover, they are well-suited for printed circuit board designs or integrated circuits
