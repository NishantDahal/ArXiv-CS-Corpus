Capacity Bounds and a Certain Capacity Region for Special Three-Receiver Broadcast Channels with Side Information

The fact that the results for 2-receiver broadcast channels (BCs) are not generalized to the 3-receiver ones is of information theoretical importance. In this paper we study two classes of discrete memoryless BCs with non-causal side information (SI), i.e. multilevel BC (MBC) and 3-receiver less noisy BC. First, we obtain an achievable rate region and a capacity outer bound for the MBC. Second, we prove a special capacity region for the 3-receiver less noisy BC. Third, the obtained special capacity region for the 3-receiver less noisy BC is extended to continuous alphabet fading Gaussian version. It is worth mentioning that the previous works are special cases of our works.
