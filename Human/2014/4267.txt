Datacenter Changes vs. Employment Rates for Datacenter Managers In the Cloud Computing Era

Due to the evolving Cloud Computing paradigm, there is a prevailing concern that in the near future data center managers may be in short supply. Cloud computing, as a whole, is becoming more prevalent into today s computing world. In fact, cloud computing has become so popular that some are now referring to data centers as cloud centers. How does this interest in cloud computing translate into employment rates for data center managers? The popularity of the public and private cloud models are the prevailing force behind answering this question. Therefore, the skill set of the datacenter manager has evolved to harness the on demand self-services, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service, and multi tenacity characteristics of cloud computing. Using diverse sources ranging from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics to trade articles, this manuscript takes an in-depth look at these employment rates related to the cloud and the determining factors behind them. Based on the information available, datacenter manager employment rates in the cloud computing era will continue to increase well into 2016.
