Privacy Shielding against Mass Surveillance

Privacy Shielding against Mass Surveillance provides a step by step tactical approach to protecting the privacy of all the users of the internet from mass surveillance programs by the governments and other state agencies. Protection of privacy is of prime importance and Privacy Shielding provides the right means against mass surveillance programs and from malicious users trying to gain access to your systems. Although protection is difficult when massive government agencies like the National Security Agency and The Government Communications Headquarters target internet users for surveillance, it is possible because the target is not you as an individual but the entire mass as a whole. With the right approach and a broad perspective of the term Privacy, it is possible for one to freely access and share information over the internet without being victims of surveillance.
