Multimodal Optimization by Sparkling Squid Populations

The swarm intelligence of animals is a natural paradigm to apply to optimization problems. Ant colony, bee colony, firefly and bat algorithms are amongst those that have been demonstrated to efficiently to optimize complex constraints. This paper proposes the new Sparkling Squid Algorithm (SSA) for multimodal optimization, inspired by the intelligent swarm behavior of its namesake. After an introduction, formulation and discussion of its implementation, it will be compared to other popular metaheuristics. Finally, applications to well - known problems such as image registration and the traveling salesperson problem will be discussed.
