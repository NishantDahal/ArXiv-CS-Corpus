Higher-Order Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithms

This paper presents a theory and an empirical evaluation of Higher-Order Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithms. Fundamental notions of the theory have been introduced, and a novel Order-2 Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm (QIGA2) has been presented. Contrary to all QIGA algorithms which represent quantum genes as independent qubits, in higher-order QIGAs quantum registers are used to represent genes strings which allows modelling of genes relations using quantum phenomena. Performance comparison has been conducted on a benchmark of 20 deceptive combinatorial optimization problems. It has been presented that using higher quantum orders is beneficial for genetic algorithm efficiency, and the new QIGA2 algorithm outperforms the old QIGA algorithm which was tuned in highly compute intensive metaoptimization process.
