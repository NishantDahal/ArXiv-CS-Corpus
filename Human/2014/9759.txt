An Analysis on Selection for High-Resolution Approximations in Many-Objective Optimization

This work studies the behavior of three elitist multi- and many-objective evolutionary algorithms generating a high-resolution approximation of the Pareto optimal set. Several search-assessment indicators are defined to trace the dynamics of survival selection and measure the ability to simultaneously keep optimal solutions and discover new ones under different population sizes, set as a fraction of the size of the Pareto optimal set.
