Radiation Pattern of Patch Antenna with Slits

The Microstrip antenna has been commercially used in many applications, such as direct broadcast satellite service, mobile satellite communications, global positioning system, medical hyperthermia usage, etc. The patch antenna of the size reduction at a given operating frequency is obtained. Mobile personal communication systems and wireless computer networks are most commonly used nowadays and they are in need of antennas in different frequency bands. In regulate to without difficulty incorporate these antennas into individual systems, a micro strip scrap transmitter have been preferred and intended for a convinced divergence. There is also an analysis of radiation pattern, Gain of the antenna, Directivity of the antenna, Electric Far Field. The simulations results are obtained by using electromagnetic simulation software called feko software are presented and discussed
