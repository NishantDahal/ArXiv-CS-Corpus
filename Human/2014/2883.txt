Using the Business Process Model and Notation for Modeling Enterprise Integration Patterns

Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) are a collection of widely used stencils for integrating enterprise applications and business processes. These patterns represent a "de-facto" standard reference for design decisions when integrating enterprise applications.
  For each of these patterns we present the integration semantics (model) and the conceptual translation (syntax) to the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), which is a "de-facto" standard for modelling business process semantics and their runtime behavior.
