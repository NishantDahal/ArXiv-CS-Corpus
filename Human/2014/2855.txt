Synchronous Relaying Of Sensor Data

In this paper we have put forth a novel methodology to relay data obtained by inbuilt sensors of smart phones in real time to remote database followed by fetching of this data . Smart phones are becoming very common and they are laced with a number of sensors that can not only be used in native applications but can also be sent to external nodes to be used by third parties for application and service development.
