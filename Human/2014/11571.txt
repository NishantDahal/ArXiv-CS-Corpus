Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Fractional Frequency Reuse in Heterogeneous Networks

Next generation wireless networks face the challenge of increasing energy consumption while satisfying the unprecedented increase in the data rate demand. To address this problem, we propose a utility-based energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm for the downlink transmissions in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). We consider the fractional frequency reuse (FFR) method in order to mitigate the intra- and inter-cell interference. The proposed algorithm divides the resource allocation problem into frequency and power assignment problems and sequentially solves them. The proposed power control algorithm uses the gradient ascent method to control the transmit power of macrocell base stations as most of the power in the network is consumed there. We also present the optimality conditions of the resource allocation problem and the convergence of the proposed algorithm. We study the performance of the proposed algorithm in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides substantial improvements in the energy efficiency and throughput of the network.
