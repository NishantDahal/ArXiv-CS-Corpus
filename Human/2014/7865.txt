Possibility neutrosophic soft sets with applications in decision making and similarity measure

In this paper, concept of possibility neutrosophic soft set and its operations are defined, and their properties are studied. An application of this theory in decision making is investigated. Also a similarity measure of two possibility neutrosophic soft sets is introduced and discussed. Finally an application of this similarity measure is given to select suitable person for position in a firm.
