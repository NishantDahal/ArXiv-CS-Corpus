An Approach for Discovering Traceability Links between Regulatory Documents and Source Code Through User-Interface Labels

In application domains that are regulated, software vendors must maintain traceability links between the regulatory items and the code base implementing them. In this paper, we present a traceability approach based on the intuition that the regulatory documents and the user-interface of the corresponding software applications are very close. First, they use the same terminology. Second, most important regulatory pieces of information appear in the graphical user-interface because the end-users in those application domains care about the regulation (by construction). We evaluate our approach in the domain of green building. The evaluation involves a domain expert, lead architect of a commercial product within this area. The evaluation shows that the recovered traceability links are accurate.
