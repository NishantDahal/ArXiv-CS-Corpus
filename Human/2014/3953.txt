Ontology as a Source for Rule Generation

This paper discloses the potential of OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies for generation of rules. The main purpose of this paper is to identify new types of rules, which may be generated from OWL ontologies. Rules, generated from OWL ontologies, are necessary for the functioning of the Semantic Web Expert System. It is expected that the Semantic Web Expert System (SWES) will be able to process ontologies from the Web with the purpose to supplement or even to develop its knowledge base.
