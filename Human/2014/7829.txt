On Uplink-Downlink Duality for Cellular IA

In our previous work we considered the uplink of a hexagonal cellular network topology and showed that linear "one-shot" interference alignment (IA) schemes are able to achieve the optimal degrees of freedom (DoFs) per user, under a decoded-message passing framework that allows base-stations to exchange their own decoded messages over local backhaul links. In this work, we provide the dual framework for the downlink of cellular networks with the same backhaul architecture, and show that for every "one-shot" IA scheme that can achieve $d$ DoFs per user in the uplink, there exists a dual "one-shot" IA scheme that can achieve the same DoFs in the downlink. To enable "Cellular IA" for the downlink, base-stations will now use the same local backhaul links to exchange quantized versions of the dirty-paper precoded signals instead of user messages.
