Tables of parameters of symmetric configurations $v_{k}$

Tables of the currently known parameters of symmetric configurations are given. Formulas for parameters of the known infinite families of symmetric configurations are presented as well. The results of the recent paper [18] are used. This work can be viewed as an appendix to [18], in the sense that the tables given here cover a much larger set of parameters.
