Run Vector Analysis and Barker Sequences of Odd Length

The run vector of a binary sequence reflects the run structure of the sequence, which is given by the set of all substrings of the run length encoding. The run vector and the aperiodic autocorrelations of a binary sequence are strongly related. In this paper, we analyze the run vector of skew-symmetric binary sequences. Using the derived results we present a new and different proof that there exists no Barker sequence of odd length n > 13. Barker sequences are binary sequences whose off-peak aperiodic autocorrelations are all in magnitude at most 1.
