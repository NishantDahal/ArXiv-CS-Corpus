Desingularization of Ore Operators

We show that Ore operators can be desingularized by calculating a least common left multiple with a random operator of appropriate order. Our result generalizes a classical result about apparent singularities of linear differential equations, and it gives rise to a surprisingly simple desingularization algorithm.
