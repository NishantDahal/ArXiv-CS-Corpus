Bond theory for pentapods and hexapods

This paper deals with the old and classical problem of determining necessary conditions for the overconstrained mobility of some mechanical device. In particular, we show that the mobility of pentapods/hexapods implies either a collinearity condition on the anchor points, or a geometric condition on the normal projections of base and platform points. The method is based on a specific compactification of the group of direct isometries of $\mathbb{R}^3$.
