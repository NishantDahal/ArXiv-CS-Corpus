Nearly Linear-Work Algorithms for Mixed Packing/Covering and Facility-Location Linear Programs

We describe the first nearly linear-time approximation algorithms for explicitly given mixed packing/covering linear programs, and for (non-metric) fractional facility location. We also describe the first parallel algorithms requiring only near-linear total work and finishing in polylog time. The algorithms compute $(1+ε)$-approximate solutions in time (and work) $O^*(N/ε^2)$, where $N$ is the number of non-zeros in the constraint matrix. For facility location, $N$ is the number of eligible client/facility pairs.
