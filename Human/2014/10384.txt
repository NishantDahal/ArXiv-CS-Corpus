An Experimental Study of Adaptive Control for Evolutionary Algorithms

The balance of exploration versus exploitation (EvE) is a key issue on evolutionary computation. In this paper we will investigate how an adaptive controller aimed to perform Operator Selection can be used to dynamically manage the EvE balance required by the search, showing that the search strategies determined by this control paradigm lead to an improvement of solution quality found by the evolutionary algorithm.
