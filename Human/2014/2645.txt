Information Retrieval (IR) through Semantic Web (SW): An Overview

A large amount of data is present on the web. It contains huge number of web pages and to find suitable information from them is very cumbersome task. There is need to organize data in formal manner so that user can easily access and use them. To retrieve information from documents, we have many Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. Current IR techniques are not so advanced that they can be able to exploit semantic knowledge within documents and give precise results. IR technology is major factor responsible for handling annotations in Semantic Web (SW) languages and in the present paper knowledgeable representation languages used for retrieving information are discussed.
