On the Inverting of A General Heptadiagonal Matrix

In this paper, we developed new numeric and symbolic algorithms to find the inverse of any nonsingular heptadiagonal matrix. Symbolic algorithm will not break and it is without setting any restrictive conditions. The computational cost of our algorithms is $O(n)$. The algorithms are suitable for implementation using computer algebra system such as MAPLE, MATLAB and MATHEMATICA. Examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithms.
