Valuable things in a museum or ancient place must be maintained well and also it need to managing visitors. To maintain things we should prevent them from theft, as well as environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, PH, chemical factors and mechanical events should be monitored. And if the conditions are damaging, appropriate alerts or reports to managers and experts should be announced. Visitors should also be monitored, as well as visitors need to be guided and getting information in the environment. By utilizing RFID technology and short-distance network tools, technical solutions for more efficient management and more effective retention in museums can be implemented.
