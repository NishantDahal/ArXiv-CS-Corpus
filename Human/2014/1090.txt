Flexible SQLf query based on fuzzy linguistic summaries

Data is often partially known, vague or ambiguous in many real world applications. To deal with such imprecise information, fuzziness is introduced in the classical model. SQLf is one of the practical language to deal with flexible fuzzy querying in Fuzzy DataBases (FDB). However, with a huge amount of fuzzy data, the necessity to work with synthetic views became a challenge for many DB community researchers. The present work deals with Flexible SQLf query based on fuzzy linguistic summaries. We use the fuzzy summaries produced by our Fuzzy-SaintEtiq approach. It provides a description of objects depending on the fuzzy linguistic labels specified as selection criteria.
