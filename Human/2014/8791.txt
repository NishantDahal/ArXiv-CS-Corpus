Cuckoo Search: Recent Advances and Applications

Cuckoo search (CS) is a relatively new algorithm, developed by Yang and Deb in 2009, and CS is efficient in solving global optimization problems. In this paper, we review the fundamental ideas of cuckoo search and the latest developments as well as its applications. We analyze the algorithm and gain insight into its search mechanisms and find out why it is efficient. We also discuss the essence of algorithms and its link to self-organizing systems, and finally we propose some important topics for further research.
