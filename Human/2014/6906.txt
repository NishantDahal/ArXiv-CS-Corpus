Proceedings Twelfth International Workshop on the ACL2 Theorem Prover and its Applications

This volume contains the proceedings of the Twelfth International Workshop on the ACL2 Theorem Prover and Its Applications, ACL2'14, a two-day workshop held in Vienna, Austria, on July 12-13, 2014. ACL2 workshops occur at approximately 18-month intervals and provide a major technical forum for researchers to present and discuss improvements and extensions to the theorem prover, comparisons of ACL2 with other systems, and applications of ACL2 in formal verification. These proceedings include 13 peer reviewed technical papers. 
  ACL2 is a state-of-the-art automated reasoning system that has been successfully applied in academia, government, and industry for specification and verification of computing systems and in teaching computer science courses. In 2005, Boyer, Kaufmann, and Moore were awarded the 2005 ACM Software System Award for their work in ACL2 and the other theorem provers in the Boyer-Moore family.
