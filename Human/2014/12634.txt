A novel approach for mobility management inf lte femtocells

LTE is an emerging wireless data communication technology to provide broadband ubiquitous Internet access. Femtocells are included in 3GPP since Release 8 to enhance the indoor network coverage and capacity. The main challenge of mobility management in hierarchical LTE structure is to guarantee efficient handover to or from/to/between Femtocells. This paper focuses, on different types of Handover and comparison performance between different decision algorithms. Furthermore, a speed based Handover algorithm for macro-femto scenario is proposed with simulation results
