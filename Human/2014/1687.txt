Fast X-ray CT image reconstruction using the linearized augmented Lagrangian method with ordered subsets

The augmented Lagrangian (AL) method that solves convex optimization problems with linear constraints has drawn more attention recently in imaging applications due to its decomposable structure for composite cost functions and empirical fast convergence rate under weak conditions. However, for problems such as X-ray computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction and large-scale sparse regression with "big data", where there is no efficient way to solve the inner least-squares problem, the AL method can be slow due to the inevitable iterative inner updates. In this paper, we focus on solving regularized (weighted) least-squares problems using a linearized variant of the AL method that replaces the quadratic AL penalty term in the scaled augmented Lagrangian with its separable quadratic surrogate (SQS) function, thus leading to a much simpler ordered-subsets (OS) accelerable splitting-based algorithm, OS-LALM, for X-ray CT image reconstruction. To further accelerate the proposed algorithm, we use a second-order recursive system analysis to design a deterministic downward continuation approach that avoids tedious parameter tuning and provides fast convergence. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm significantly accelerates the "convergence" of X-ray CT image reconstruction with negligible overhead and greatly reduces the OS artifacts in the reconstructed image when using many subsets for OS acceleration.
