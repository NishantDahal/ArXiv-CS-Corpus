Advanced Signal Processing Techniqes to Study Normal and Epileptic EEG

EEG monitoring has an important milestone provide valuable information of those candidates who suffer from epilepsy.In this paper human normal and epileptic Electroencephalogram signals are analyzed with popular and efficient signal processing techniques like Fourier and Wavelet transform. The delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma sub bands of EEG are obtained and studied for detection of seizure and epilepsy. The extracted feature is then applied to ANN for classification of the EEG signals.
