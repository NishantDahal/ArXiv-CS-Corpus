Technological and Cost based Analysis of Future-Proof Fiber Access Passive Networks: GPON and WDM PON

This paper discusses the key principles of Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) which is based on Time Division Multiplexing Passive Optical Network (TDM PON) and Wavelength Division Multiplexing Passive Optical Network (WDM PON), which is considered to be next generation passive optical network. In the present day scenario, access to broad- band is increasing at a rapid pace. Because of the advantages of fiber access in terms of capacity and cost, most of the countries have started deploying GPON access as an important part of national strategy. Though GPON is promising, it has few limitations. On the other hand WDM PON, a next generation network, is quite promising unlike GPON, it is easily scalable and interoperable with different vendors. This paper provides an overview of GPON, WDM PON and its key dissimilarities based on technicalities and cost.
