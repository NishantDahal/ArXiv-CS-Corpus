An Evolutionary Approach for Optimal Citing and Sizing of Micro-Grid in Radial Distribution Systems

This Paper presents the methodology of penetration of Micro-Grids (MG) in the radial distribution system (RDS). The aim of this paper is to minimize a total real power loss that descends the performance of the radial distribution system by integrating various renewable resources as Distributed Generation (DG). The combination of different types of renewable energy resources contributes a sustainable MG. These resources are optimally sized and located using evolutionary approach in various penetration levels. The optimal solutions are experimented with IEEE 33 radial distribution system using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. The results are quite promising and authenticate its potential to solve problem in radial distribution system effectively.
