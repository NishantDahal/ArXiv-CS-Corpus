Improving Energy Efficiency of MPTCP for Mobile Devices

Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) is a new transport protocol that enables systems to exploit available paths through multiple network interfaces. MPTCP is particularly useful for mobile devices, which usually have multiple wireless interfaces. However, these devices have limited power capacity and thus judicious use of these interfaces is required. In this work, we develop a model for MPTCP energy consumption derived from experimental measurements using MPTCP on a mobile device with both cellular and WiFi interfaces. Using our energy model, we identify an operating region where there is scope to improve power efficiency compared to both standard TCP and MPTCP. We design and implement an improved energy-efficient MPTCP, called eMPTCP. We evaluate eMPTCP on a mobile device across several scenarios, including varying bandwidth, background traffic, and user mobility. Our results show that eMPTCP can reduce the power consumption by up to 15% compared with MPTCP, while preserving the availability and robustness benefits of MPTCP. Furthermore, we show that when compared with TCP over WiFi, which is more energy efficient than TCP over LTE, eMPTCP obtains significantly better performance with relatively little additional energy overhead.
