Quantum Cost Optimization for Reversible Sequential Circuit

Reversible sequential circuits are going to be the significant memory blocks for the forthcoming computing devices for their ultra low power consumption. Therefore design of various types of latches has been considered a major objective for the researchers quite a long time. In this paper we proposed efficient design of reversible sequential circuits that are optimized in terms of quantum cost, delay and garbage outputs. For this we proposed a new 3*3 reversible gate called SAM gate and we then design efficient sequential circuits using SAM gate along with some of the basic reversible logic gates.
