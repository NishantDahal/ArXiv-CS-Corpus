Securing Cloud from Cloud Drain

Today, in the world of communication, connected systems is growing at a rapid pace. To accommodate this growth the need for computational power and storage is also increasing at a similar rate. Companies are investing a large amount of resources in buying, maintaining and ensuring availability of the system to their customers. To mitigate these issues, cloud computing is playing a major role.The underlying concept of cloud computing dates back to the 50's but the term entering into widespread usage can be traced to 2006 when Amazon.com announced the Elastic Compute Cloud.In this paper, we will discuss about cloud security approaches. We have used the term Cloud-Drain to define data leakage in case of security compromise.
