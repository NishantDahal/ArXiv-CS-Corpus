A Statistical Model of Information Evaporation of Perfectly Reflecting Black Holes

We provide a statistical communication model for the phenomenon of quantum information evaporation from black holes. A black hole behaves as a reflecting quantum channel in a very special regime, which allows for a receiver to perfectly recover the absorbed quantum information. The quantum channel of a perfectly reflecting (PR) black hole is the probabilistically weighted sum of infinitely many qubit cloning channels. In this work, we reveal the statistical communication background of the information evaporation process of PR black holes. We show that the density of the cloned quantum particles in function of the PR black hole's mass approximates a Chi-square distribution, while the stimulated emission process is characterized by zero-mean, circular symmetric complex Gaussian random variables. The results lead to the existence of Rayleigh random distributed coefficients in the probability density evolution, which confirms the presence of Rayleigh fading (a special type of random fluctuation) in the statistical communication model of black hole information evaporation.
