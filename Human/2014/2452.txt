Coding for Combined Block-Symbol Error Correction

We design low-complexity error correction coding schemes for channels that introduce different types of errors and erasures: on the one hand, the proposed schemes can successfully deal with symbol errors and erasures, and, on the other hand, they can also successfully handle phased burst errors and erasures.
