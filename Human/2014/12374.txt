Developing a SAAS-Cloud Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for C, C++, and Java

Cloud era brought revolution of computerization world. People could access their data from anywhere and anytime with different devices. One of the cloud's model is Software as a Service, which capable to provide applications that run on a cloud infrastructure.An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the most popular tool to develop application in the network or single computer development. By installing IDE in each computer of the network could causes the lot of time and budget spending. The objective of the research is developing an efficient cloud based IDE. The IDE could compile the code which sent from client browser through SaaS IDE to the server and send it back to the client. The method that used in the research is the System Development Life-Cycle: Waterfall and Unified Model Language as system designing tool. The research successfully produced the cloud-based SaaS IDE with excellent result from several testing in local network and internet.
