Constructions of Optimal and Near-Optimal Multiply Constant-Weight Codes

Multiply constant-weight codes (MCWCs) have been recently studied to improve the reliability of certain physically unclonable function response. In this paper, we give combinatorial constructions for MCWCs which yield several new infinite families of optimal MCWCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Johnson type upper bounds of MCWCs are asymptotically tight for fixed weights and distances. Finally, we provide bounds and constructions of two dimensional MCWCs.
