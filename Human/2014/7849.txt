Faster polynomial multiplication over finite fields

Let p be a prime, and let M_p(n) denote the bit complexity of multiplying two polynomials in F_p[X] of degree less than n. For n large compared to p, we establish the bound M_p(n) = O(n log n 8^(log^* n) log p), where log^* is the iterated logarithm. This is the first known FÃ¼rer-type complexity bound for F_p[X], and improves on the previously best known bound M_p(n) = O(n log n log log n log p).
