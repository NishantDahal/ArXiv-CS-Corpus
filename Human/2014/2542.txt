Comparative Study of the Function Overloading and Function Overriding Using C++

In the Object-Oriented Programming Systems (OOPS), these two concepts namely function overloading and function overriding are a bit confusing to the programmers. In this article this confusion is tried to be removed. Both of these are the concepts which come under the polymorphism (poly means many and morph mean forms). In the article the comparison is done in between them. For the new programmers and the learners, it is important to understand them. The function overloading [1] is achieved at the time of the compile and the function overriding is achieved at the run time. The function overriding always takes place in inheritance, but the function overloading can also take place without inheritance.
