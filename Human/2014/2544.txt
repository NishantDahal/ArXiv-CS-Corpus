Study on performance improvement of oil paint image filter algorithm using parallel pattern library

This paper gives a detailed study on the performance of oil paint image filter algorithm with various parameters applied on an image of RGB model. Oil Paint image processing, being very performance hungry, current research tries to find improvement using parallel pattern library. With increasing kernel-size, the processing time of oil paint image filter algorithm increases exponentially.
