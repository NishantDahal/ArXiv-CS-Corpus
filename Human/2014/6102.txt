Euclidean Partitions Optimizing Noise Stability

The Standard Simplex Conjecture of Isaksson and Mossel asks for the partition $\{A_{i}\}_{i=1}^{k}$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ into $k\leq n+1$ pieces of equal Gaussian measure of optimal noise stability. That is, for $ρ>0$, we maximize $$ \sum_{i=1}^{k}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}1_{A_{i}}(x)1_{A_{i}}(xρ+y\sqrt{1-ρ^{2}}) e^{-(x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2})/2}e^{-(y_{1}^{2}+\cdots+y_{n}^{2})/2}dxdy. $$ Isaksson and Mossel guessed the best partition for this problem and proved some applications of their conjecture. For example, the Standard Simplex Conjecture implies the Plurality is Stablest Conjecture. For $k=3,n\geq2$ and $0<ρ<ρ_{0}(k,n)$, we prove the Standard Simplex Conjecture. The full conjecture has applications to theoretical computer science, and to geometric multi-bubble problems (after Isaksson and Mossel).
