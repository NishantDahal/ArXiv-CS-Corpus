Online placement test based on Item Response Theory and IMS Global standards

This paper aims to present an online placement test. It is based on the Item Response Theory to provide relevant estimates of learner competences. The proposed test is the entry point of our e-Learning system. It gathers the learner response to a set of questions and uses a specific developed algorithm to estimate its level. This algorithm identifies learning gaps, which allows tutors to conceive sequence of courses and remediation adapted to each case of learner, in order to achieve a competence.
