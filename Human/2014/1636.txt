Formal Description of Components in Operating Systems

The contemporary development of hardware components is a prerequisite for increasing the concentration of computing power. System software is developing at a much slower pace. To use available resources efficiently modeling is required. Formalization of elements, present in the material, provides the basis for modeling. Examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the concept.
