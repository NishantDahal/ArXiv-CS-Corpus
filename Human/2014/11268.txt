Initialization of lattice Boltzmann models with the help of the numerical Chapman-Enskog expansion

We extend the applicability of the numerical Chapman-Enskog expansion as a lifting operator for lattice Boltzmann models to map density and momentum to distribution functions. In earlier work [Vanderhoydonc et al. Multiscale Model. Simul. 10(3): 766-791, 2012] such an expansion was constructed in the context of lifting only the zeroth order velocity moment, namely the density. A lifting operator is necessary to convert information from the macroscopic to the mesoscopic scale. This operator is used for the initialization of lattice Boltzmann models. Given only density and momentum, the goal is to initialize the distribution functions of lattice Boltzmann models. For this initialization, the numerical Chapman-Enskog expansion is used in this paper.
