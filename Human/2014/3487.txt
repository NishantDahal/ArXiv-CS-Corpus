Taming the zoo - about algorithms implementation in the ecosystem of Apache Hadoop

Content Analysis System (CoAnSys) is a research framework for mining scientific publications using Apache Hadoop. This article describes the algorithms currently implemented in CoAnSys including classification, categorization and citation matching of scientific publications. The size of the input data classifies these algorithms in the range of big data problems, which can be efficiently solved on Hadoop clusters.
