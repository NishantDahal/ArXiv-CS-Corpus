Improvement Tracking Dynamic Programming using Replication Function for Continuous Sign Language Recognition

In this paper we used a Replication Function (R. F.)for improvement tracking with dynamic programming. The R. F. transforms values of gray level [0 255] to [0 1]. The resulting images of R. F. are more striking and visible in skin regions. The R. F. improves Dynamic Programming (D. P.) in overlapping hand and face. Results show that Tracking Error Rate 11% and Average Tracked Distance 7% reduced
