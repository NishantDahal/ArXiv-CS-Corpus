A Morphological Analyzer for Japanese Nouns, Verbs and Adjectives

We present an open source morphological analyzer for Japanese nouns, verbs and adjectives. The system builds upon the morphological analyzing capabilities of MeCab to incorporate finer details of classification such as politeness, tense, mood and voice attributes. We implemented our analyzer in the form of a finite state transducer using the open source finite state compiler FOMA toolkit. The source code and tool is available at https://bitbucket.org/skylander/yc-nlplab/.
