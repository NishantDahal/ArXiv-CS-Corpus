BT-GPSR: An Integrated Trust Model for Secure Geographic Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks

Geographic routing offers guaranteed packet deliv- ery in a dense network. In this routing, packets are forwarded to a node which is nearer to the destination with an extensive use of location information. However, research studies in Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have shown that packet delivery percentage can degrade substantially when malicious nodes are found in the network. Conventional cryptography techniques can be adopted in order to deal with ma- licious nodes, but they cannot mitigate outsider attacks. In recent years, a societal pattern called trust is used as a tool to mitigate security attacks. Numerous researchers have proposed security solutions by adopting trust in routing algorithms. However, each solution has its own strength and weakness. In this paper, an integrated approach by using reputation and weight based trust systems backed by Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (BT-GPSR) is presented. The proposed approach outperforms the conventional reputation and weight based methods. The effectiveness of the proposed BT-GPSR is validated through simulation.
