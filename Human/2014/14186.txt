Dynamic aerodynamic-structural coupling numerical simulation on the flexible wing of a cicada based on ansys

Most biological flyers undergo orderly deformation in flight, and the deformations of wings lead to complex fluid-structure interactions. In this paper, an aerodynamic-structural coupling method of flapping wing is developed based on ANSYS to simulate the flapping of flexible wing. Fluent module and Transient Structural module are connected through the System Coupling module to make a two-way fluid-structure Coupling computational framework. Comparing with the rigid wing of a cicada, the coupling results of the flexible wing shows that the flexible deformation can increase the aerodynamic performances of flapping flight.
