Visualizing and Quantifying Impact and Effect in Twitter Narrative using Geometric Data Analysis

We use geometric multivariate data analysis which has been termed a methodology for both the visualization and verbalization of data. The general objectives are data mining and knowledge discovery. In the first case study, we use the narrative surrounding very highly profiled tweets, and thus a Twitter event of significance and importance. In the second case study, we use eight carefully planned Twitter campaigns relating to environmental issues. The aim of these campaigns was to increase environmental awareness and behaviour. Unlike current marketing, political and other communication campaigns using Twitter, we develop an innovative approach to measuring bevavioural change. We show also how we can assess statistical significance of social media behaviour.
