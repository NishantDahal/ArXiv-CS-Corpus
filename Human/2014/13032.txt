Optimal strongly conflict-avoiding codes of even length and weight three

Strongly conflict-avoiding codes (SCACs) are employed in a slot-asynchronous multiple-access collision channel without feedback to guarantee that each active user can send at least one packet successfully in the worst case within a fixed period of time. Assume all users are assigned distinct codewords, the number of codewords in an SCAC is equal to the number of potential users that can be supported. SCACs have different combinatorial structure compared with conflict-avoiding codes (CACs) due to additional collisions incurred by partially overlapped transmissions. In this paper, we establish upper bounds on the size of SCACs of even length and weight three. Furthermore, it is shown that some optimal CACs can be used to construct optimal SCACs of weight three.
