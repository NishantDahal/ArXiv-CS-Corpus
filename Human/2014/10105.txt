Low-High SNR Transition in Multiuser MIMO

Multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) plays a key role in the widely adopted 3GPP LTE standard for wireless cellular networks. While exact and asymptotic sum-rate results are well known, the problem of obtaining intuitive analytical results for medium signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) is still not solved. In this paper, we propose the bend point, which quantifies the transition between low and high SNR; i.e., the beginning of the high SNR region. We derive the bend point for MU-MIMO with zero-forcing precoding and show that it is intimately related to the intercept of the high SNR asymptote with the zero sum-rate line. Using this result, we obtain a new approximation of the sum-rate at the bend point---providing a useful rule of thumb for the effect of increasing the number of antennas at medium SNR.
