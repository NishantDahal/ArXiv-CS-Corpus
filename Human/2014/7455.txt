When Augmented Reality Meets Big Data

With computing and sensing woven into the fabric of everyday life, we live in an era where we are awash in a flood of data from which we can gain rich insights. Augmented reality (AR) is able to collect and help analyze the growing torrent of data about user engagement metrics within our personal mobile and wearable devices. This enables us to blend information from our senses and the digitalized world in a myriad of ways that was not possible before. AR and big data have a logical maturity that inevitably converge them. The tread of harnessing AR and big data to breed new interesting applications is starting to have a tangible presence. In this paper, we explore the potential to capture value from the marriage between AR and big data technologies, following with several challenges that must be addressed to fully realize this potential.
