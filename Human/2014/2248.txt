A Brief History of Learning Classifier Systems: From CS-1 to XCS

Modern Learning Classifier Systems can be characterized by their use of rule accuracy as the utility metric for the search algorithm(s) discovering useful rules. Such searching typically takes place within the restricted space of co-active rules for efficiency. This paper gives an historical overview of the evolution of such systems up to XCS, and then some of the subsequent developments of XCS to different types of learning.
