A methodology to identify the level of reuse using template factors

To build large scale software systems, Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) has played a vital role. The current practices of software industry demands more development of a software within time and budget which is highly productive to them. It became so necessary to achieve how effectively the software component is reusable. In order to meet this, the component level reuse, in terms of both class and method level can be possibly done. The traditional approaches are presented in the literature upto the level of extent of achievement of reuse. Any how still effective reuse is a challenging issue as a part. In this paper, a methodology has proposed for the identification of reuse level which has been considered by the using reuse metrics such as the Class Template Factor(CTF) and Method Template Factor(MTF). By considering these measures makes easy to identify the level of reuse so that helps in the growth the productivity in the organization.
