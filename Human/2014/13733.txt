Proceedings 3rd International Workshop on Trends in Functional Programming in Education

The goal of TFPIE is to gather researchers, professors, teachers, and all professionals interested in functional programming in education. This includes the teaching of functional programming, but also the application of functional programming as a tool for teaching other topics. The post-workshop review process received 13 submissions, which were vetted by the program committee, assuming scientific journal standards of publication. The six articles in this volume were selected for publication as the result of this process.
