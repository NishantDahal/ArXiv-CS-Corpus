Spatial Modelling Techniques in Microsoft Excel

We begin by considering the expectations of the creators of VisiCalc, the first spreadsheet. The emphasis is on the nature of the spreadsheet grid. The grid is taken as a presentational method for showing a solution to a Sudoku puzzle. We consider methods or approaches for the solution. We look at the relationship between this model and academic papers on the methods for describing and categorising end-user models generally. We consider whether the type of model described here should be categorised separately. The complexity of the model is reviewed in the context of commendations to minimise overly sophisticated presentational constructs and formulae.
