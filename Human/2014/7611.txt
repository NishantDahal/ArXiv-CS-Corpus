Decoding of Differential AG Codes

The interpolation-based decoding that was developed for general evaluation AG codes is shown to be equally applicable to general differential AG codes. A performance analysis of the decoding algorithm, which is parallel to that of its companion algorithm, is reported. In particular, the decoding capacities of evaluation AG codes and differential AG codes are seen to be nicely interrelated. As an interesting special case, a decoding algorithm for classical Goppa codes is presented.
