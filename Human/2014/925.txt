A study of Monte-Carlo method in a teachers' training institute

The problem of Monte-Carlo method study at computer simulation lessons in a Teachers' Training Institute is reviewed in the article. The suggested technique envisages the simulation modelling of various stochastic processes. They include transmission of information via a communication link, oscillation of a pendulum in an air stream, deflection of alpha particles by Au atoms, formation of a percolating cluster, etc. (New educational technologies in higher education institution: the collection of reports of the tenth international scientific and methodical conference.
