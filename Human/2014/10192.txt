Concept-oriented model: inference in hierarchical multidimensional space

In spite of its fundamental importance, inference has not been an inherent function of multidimensional models and analytical applications. These models are mainly aimed at numeric (quantitative) analysis where the notions of inference and semantics are not well defined. In this paper we argue that inference can be and should be integral part of multidimensional data models and analytical applications. It is demonstrated how inference can be defined using only multidimensional terms like axes and coordinates as opposed to using logic-based approaches. We propose a novel approach to inference in multidimensional space based on the concept-oriented model of data and introduce elementary operations which are then used to define constraint propagation and inference procedures. We describe a query language with inference operator and demonstrate its usefulness in solving complex analytical tasks.
