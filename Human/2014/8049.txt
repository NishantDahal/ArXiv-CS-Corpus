Les noms propres se traduisent-ils ? Ã‰tude d'un corpus multilingue

In this paper, we tackle the problem of the translation of proper names. We introduce our hypothesis according to which proper names can be translated more often than most people seem to think. Then, we describe the construction of a parallel multilingual corpus used to illustrate our point. We eventually evaluate both the advantages and limits of this corpus in our study.
