Note on the number of edges in families with linear union-complexity

We give a simple argument showing that the number of edges in the intersection graph $G$ of a family of $n$ sets in the plane with a linear union-complexity is $O(ω(G)n)$. In particular, we prove $χ(G)\leq \text{col}(G)< 19ω(G)$ for intersection graph $G$ of a family of pseudo-discs, which improves a previous bound.
