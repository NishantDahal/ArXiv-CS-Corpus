Ageing of the 2+1 dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang model

Extended dynamical simulations have been performed on a 2+1 dimensional driven dimer lattice gas model to estimate ageing properties. The auto-correlation and the auto-response functions are determined and the corresponding scaling exponents are tabulated. Since this model can be mapped onto the 2+1 dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang surface growth model, our results contribute to the understanding of the universality class of that basic system.
