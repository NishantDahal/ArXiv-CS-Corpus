Auto-adaptative Laplacian Pyramids for High-dimensional Data Analysis

Non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques such as manifold learning algorithms have become a common way for processing and analyzing high-dimensional patterns that often have attached a target that corresponds to the value of an unknown function. Their application to new points consists in two steps: first, embedding the new data point into the low dimensional space and then, estimating the function value on the test point from its neighbors in the embedded space.
  However, finding the low dimension representation of a test point, while easy for simple but often not powerful enough procedures such as PCA, can be much more complicated for methods that rely on some kind of eigenanalysis, such as Spectral Clustering (SC) or Diffusion Maps (DM). Similarly, when a target function is to be evaluated, averaging methods like nearest neighbors may give unstable results if the function is noisy. Thus, the smoothing of the target function with respect to the intrinsic, low-dimensional representation that describes the geometric structure of the examined data is a challenging task.
  In this paper we propose Auto-adaptive Laplacian Pyramids (ALP), an extension of the standard Laplacian Pyramids model that incorporates a modified LOOCV procedure that avoids the large cost of the standard one and offers the following advantages: (i) it selects automatically the optimal function resolution (stopping time) adapted to the data and its noise, (ii) it is easy to apply as it does not require parameterization, (iii) it does not overfit the training set and (iv) it adds no extra cost compared to other classical interpolation methods. We illustrate numerically ALP's behavior on a synthetic problem and apply it to the computation of the DM projection of new patterns and to the extension to them of target function values on a radiation forecasting problem over very high dimensional patterns.
