Some Properties of Brzozowski Derivatives of Regular Expressions

Brzozowski derivatives of a regular expression are developed for constructing deterministic automata from the given regular expression in the algebraic way. In this paper,some lemmas of the regular expressions are discussed and the regular languages of the derivatives are illustrated. Also the generalizations of the Brzozowski derivatives are proved as theorems with help of properties and known results.
