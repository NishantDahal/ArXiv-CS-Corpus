DNACloud: A Potential Tool for storing Big Data on DNA

The term Big Data is usually used to describe huge amount of data that is generated by humans from digital media such as cameras, internet, phones, sensors etc. By building advanced analytics on the top of big data, one can predict many things about the user such as behavior, interest etc. However before one can use the data, one has to address many issues for big data storage. Two main issues are the need of large storage devices and the cost associated with it. Synthetic DNA storage seems to be an appropriate solution to address these issues of the big data. Recently in 2013, Goldman and his collegues from European Bioinformatics Institute demonstrated the use of the DNA as storage medium with capacity of storing 2.2 peta bytes of information on one gram of DNA and retrived the data successfully with low error rate. This significant step shows a promise for synthetic DNA storage as a useful technology for the future data storage. Motivated by this, we have developed a software called DNACloud which makes it easy to store the data on the DNA. In this work, we present detailed description of the software.
