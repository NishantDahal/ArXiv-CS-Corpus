Improvement of Spectrum Sharing using Traffic pattern prediction

The paper focuses on improving the spectrum sharing using NSU, FLS and Traffic Pattern Prediction and also made comparison that traffic pattern prediction provides a better way of improving the spectrum utilization and avoids the spectrum scarcity. This helps to increase the number of active users, ease of identification of optimal users to use the spectrum with maximized coverage of the spectrum.. We experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of our approach using NS2 simulator and showed that after predicting the traffic, we can accommodate more number of users and avoiding Interference.
