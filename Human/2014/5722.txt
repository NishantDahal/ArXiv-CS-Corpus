Proceedings Third International Workshop on Engineering Safety and Security Systems

The International Workshop on Engineering Safety and Security Systems (ESSS) aims at contributing to the challenge of constructing reliable and secure systems. The workshop covers areas such as formal specification, type checking, model checking, program analysis/transformation, model-based testing and model-driven software construction. The workshop will bring together researchers and industry R&D expertise together to exchange their knowledge, discuss their research findings, and explore potential collaborations. The main theme of the workshop is methods and techniques for constructing large reliable and secure systems. The goal of the workshop is to establish a platform for the exchange of ideas,  discussion, cross-fertilization, inspiration, co-operation, and dissemination.
