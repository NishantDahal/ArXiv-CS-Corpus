On Designing Better Tools for Learning APIs

Modern software development requires a large investment in learning application programming interfaces (APIs). Recent research found that the learning materials themselves are often inadequate: developers struggle to find answers beyond simple usage scenarios. Solving these problems requires a large investment in tool and search engine development. To understand where further investment would be most useful, we ran a study with 19 professional developers to understand what a solution might look like, free of technical constraints. In this paper, we report on design implications of tools for API learning, grounded in the reality of the professional developers themselves. The reoccurring themes in the participants' feedback were trustworthiness, confidentiality, information overload and the need for code examples as first-class documentation artifacts.
