Authorship Analysis based on Data Compression

This paper proposes to perform authorship analysis using the Fast Compression Distance (FCD), a similarity measure based on compression with dictionaries directly extracted from the written texts. The FCD computes a similarity between two documents through an effective binary search on the intersection set between the two related dictionaries. In the reported experiments the proposed method is applied to documents which are heterogeneous in style, written in five different languages and coming from different historical periods. Results are comparable to the state of the art and outperform traditional compression-based methods.
