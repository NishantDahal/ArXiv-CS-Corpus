A Retrieval Mechanism for Multi-versioned Digital Collection Using TAG

As the marvellous growth of the digital library in each year, the problems with indexing and searching a digital library is increased in a high rate. When the researchers search for the earlier versions, only a few recent versions in the back volumes can be retrieved soon. It is unpredictable that researchers require the earlier versions in a specific boundary. In order to facilitate the researchers, who may access any version at any time, we propose a VTAG technique for indexing. Our experiments indicate that the proposed retrieval technique, VTAG, effectively retrieves any version in considerable amount of time than the existing method.
