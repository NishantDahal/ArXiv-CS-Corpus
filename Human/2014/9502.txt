Outage Analysis of Uplink Two-tier Networks

Employing multi-tier networks is among the most promising approaches to address the rapid growth of the data demand in cellular networks. In this paper, we study a two-tier uplink cellular network consisting of femtocells and a macrocell. Femto base stations, and femto and macro users are assumed to be spatially deployed based on independent Poisson point processes. We consider an open access assignment policy, where each macro user based on the ratio between its distances from its nearest femto access point (FAP) and from the macro base station (MBS) is assigned to either of them. By tuning the threshold, this policy allows controlling the coverage areas of FAPs. For a fixed threshold, femtocells coverage areas depend on their distances from the MBS; Those closest to the fringes will have the largest coverage areas. Under this open-access policy, ignoring the additive noise, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the outage probabilities of femto users and macro users that are subject to fading and path loss. We also study the effect of the distance from the MBS on the outage probability experienced by the users of a femtocell. In all cases, our simulation results comply with our analytical bounds.
