Problem Complexity in Parallel Problem Solving

Recent works examine the relationship between the communication structure and the performance of a group in a problem solving task. Some conclude that inefficient communication networks with long paths outperform efficient networks on the long run. Others find no influence of the network topology on group performance. We contribute to this discussion by examining the role of problem complexity. In particular, we study whether and how the complexity of the problem at hand moderates the influence of the communication network on group performance. Results obtained from multi-agent modelling suggest that problem complexity indeed has an influence. We observe an influence of the network only for problems of moderate difficulty. For easier or harder problems, the influence of network topology becomes weaker or irrelevant, which offers a possible explanation for inconsistencies in the literature.
