Circle detection using electro-magnetism optimization

This paper describes a circle detection method based on Electromagnetism-Like Optimization (EMO). Circle detection has received considerable attention over the last years thanks to its relevance for many computer vision tasks. EMO is a heuristic method for solving complex optimization problems inspired in electromagnetism principles. This algorithm searches a solution based in the attraction and repulsion among prototype candidates. In this paper the detection process is considered to be similar to an optimization problem, the algorithm uses the combination of three edge points (x, y, r) as parameters to determine circles candidates in the scene. An objective function determines if such circle candidates are actually present in the image. The EMO algorithm is used to find the circle candidate that is better related with the real circle present in the image according to the objective function. The final algorithm is a fast circle detector that locates circles with sub-pixel accuracy even considering complicated conditions and noisy images.
