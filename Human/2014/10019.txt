An improvement of a cryptanalysis algorithm

In this paper we present experiments in order to show how some pseudo random number generators can improve the effectiveness of a statistical cryptanalysis algorithm. We deduce mainly that a better generator enhance the accuracy of the cryptanalysis algorithm.
