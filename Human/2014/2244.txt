Excess Risk Bounds for Exponentially Concave Losses

The overarching goal of this paper is to derive excess risk bounds for learning from exp-concave loss functions in passive and sequential learning settings. Exp-concave loss functions encompass several fundamental problems in machine learning such as squared loss in linear regression, logistic loss in classification, and negative logarithm loss in portfolio management. In batch setting, we obtain sharp bounds on the performance of empirical risk minimization performed in a linear hypothesis space and with respect to the exp-concave loss functions. We also extend the results to the online setting where the learner receives the training examples in a sequential manner. We propose an online learning algorithm that is a properly modified version of online Newton method to obtain sharp risk bounds. Under an additional mild assumption on the loss function, we show that in both settings we are able to achieve an excess risk bound of $O(d\log n/n)$ that holds with a high probability.
