Limits to the scope of applicability of extended formulations for LP models of combinatorial optimization problems: A summary

We show that new definitions of the notion of "projection" on which some of the recent "extended formulations" works (such as Kaibel (2011); Fiorini et al. (2011; 2012); Kaibel and Walter (2013); Kaibel and Weltge (2013) for example) have been based can cause those works to over-reach in their conclusions in relating polytopes to one another when the sets of the descriptive variables for those polytopes are disjoint.
