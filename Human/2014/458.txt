An algorithm for calculating steady state probabilities of $M|E_r|c|K$ queueing systems

This paper presents a method for calculating steady state probabilities of $M|E_r|c|K$ queueing systems. The infinitesimal generator matrix is used to define all possible states in the system and their transition probabilities. While this matrix can be written down immediately for many other $M|PH|c|K$ queueing systems with phase-type service times (e.g. Coxian, Hypoexponential, \ldots), it requires a more careful analysis for systems with Erlangian service times. The constructed matrix may then be used to calculate steady state probabilities using an iterative algorithm. The resulting steady state probabilities can be used to calculate various performance measures, e.g. the average queue length. Additionally, computational issues of the implementation are discussed and an example from the field of telecommunication call-center queue length will be outlined to substantiate the applicability of these efforts. In the appendix, tables of the average queueing length given a specific number of service channels, traffic density, and system size are presented.
