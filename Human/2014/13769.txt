Domotic Embedded System

This paper presents an original domotic embedded system for room temperature monitoring. The OpenRemote is the main software interface between the user and the system, but other software components and communication protocols are used, such as 1-Wire protocol for temperature monitoring devices, RS-232 for the central PC unit and OWFS software for remote control using Android mobile devices. The system architecture consists in hardware and software components to remote control a room temperature parameter for energy efficiency increasing.
