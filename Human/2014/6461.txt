Fast Trace Generation of Many-Core Embedded Systems with Native Simulation

Embedded Software development and optimization are complex tasks. Late availably of hardware platforms, their usual low visibility and controllability, and their limiting resource constraints makes early performance estimation an attractive option instead of using the final execution platform. With early performance estimation, software development can progress although the real hardware is not yet available or it is too complex to interact with. In this paper, we present how the native simulation framework SCoPE is extended to generate OTF trace files. Those trace files can be later visualized with trace visualization tools, which recently were only used to optimize HPC workloads in order to iterate in the development process.
