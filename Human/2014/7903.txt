Run-time extensibility and librarization of simulation software

Build-time configuration and environment assumptions are hampering progress and usability in scientific software. That which would be utterly unacceptable in non-scientific software somehow passes for the norm in scientific packages. The community needs reusable software packages that are easy use and flexible enough to accommodate next-generation simulation and analysis demands.
