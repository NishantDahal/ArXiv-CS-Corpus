Wyrm, A Pythonic Toolbox for Brain-Computer Interfacing

A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a system that measures central nervous system activity and translates the recorded data into an output suitable for a computer to use as an input signal. Such a BCI system consists of three parts, the signal acquisition, the signal processing and the feedback/stimulus presentation. In this paper we present Wyrm, a signal processing toolbox for BCI in Python. Wyrm is applicable to a broad range of neuroscientific problems and capable for running online experiments in real time and off-line data analysis and visualisation.
