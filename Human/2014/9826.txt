Sign-Compute-Resolve for Random Access

We present an approach to random access that is based on three elements: physical-layer network coding, signature codes and tree splitting. Upon occurrence of a collision, physical-layer network coding enables the receiver to decode the sum of the information that was transmitted by the individual users. For each user this information consists of the data that the user wants to communicate as well as the user's signature. As long as no more than $K$ users collide, their identities can be recovered from the sum of their signatures. A splitting protocol is used to deal with the case that more than $K$ users collide. We measure the performance of the proposed method in terms of user resolution rate as well as overall throughput of the system. The results show that our approach significantly increases the performance of the system even compared to coded random access, where collisions are not wasted, but are reused in successive interference cancellation.
