Interference Alignment for Multicell Multiuser MIMO Uplink Channels

This paper proposes a linear interference alignment (IA) scheme which can be used for uplink channels in a general multicell multiuser MIMO cellular network. The proposed scheme aims to align interference caused by signals from a set of transmitters into a subspace which is established by the signals from only a subset of those transmitters, thereby effectively reducing the number of interfering transmitters. The total degrees of freedom (DoF) achievable by the proposed scheme is given in closed-form expression, and a numerical analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve the optimal DoF in certain scenarios and provides a higher total DoF than other related schemes in most cases.
