On Negacyclic MDS-Convolutional Codes

New families of classical and quantum optimal negacyclic convolutional codes are constructed in this paper. This optimality is in the sense that they attain the classical (quantum) generalized Singleton bound. The constructions presented in this paper are performed algebraically and not by computational search.
