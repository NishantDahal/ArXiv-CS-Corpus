SAT for pedestrians

The aim of this short note is mainly pedagogical. It summarizes some knowledge about Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and the P=NP? problem in an elementary mathematical language. A convenient scheme to visualize and manipulate CNF formulae is introduced. Also some results like the formulae for the number of unsatisfied clauses and the number of solutions might be unknown.
