Performance Analysis of Multi-Antenna Relay Networks over Nakagami-m Fading Channel

In this chapter, the authors present the performance of multi-antenna selective combining decode-and-forward (SC-DF) relay networks over independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Nakagami-m fading channels. The outage probability, moment generation function, symbol error probability and average channel capacity are derived in closed-form using the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) statistical characteristics. After that, the authors formulate the outage probability problem, optimize it with an approximated problem, and then solve it analytically. Finally, for comparison with analytical formulas, the authors perform some Monte-Carlo simulations.
