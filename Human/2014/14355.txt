Further improvements of determinization methods for fuzzy finite automata

In this paper we combine determinization and state reduction methods into two-in-one algorithms that simultaneously perform determinization and state reduction. These algorithms perform better than all previous determinization algorithms for fuzzy finite automata, developed by Belohlavek [Inform Sciences 143 (2002) 205-209], Li and Pedrycz [Fuzzy Set Syst 156 (2005) 68-92], Ignjatović et al. [Inform Sciences 178 (2008) 164-180], and Jančić et al. [Inform Sciences 181 (2011) 1358-1368], in the sense that they produce smaller automata, while require the same computation time. The only exception is the Brzozowski type determinization algorithm developed recently by Jančić and Ćirić [Fuzzy Set Syst (2014), to appear], which produces a minimal crisp-deterministic fuzzy automaton, but the algorithms created here can also be used within the Brzozowski type algorithm and improve its performances.
