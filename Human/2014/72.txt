Use HMM and KNN for classifying corneal data

These days to gain classification system with high accuracy that can classify complicated pattern are so useful in medicine and industry. In this article a process for getting the best classifier for Lasik data is suggested. However at first it's been tried to find the best line and curve by this classifier in order to gain classifier fitting, and in the end by using the Markov method a classifier for topographies is gained.
