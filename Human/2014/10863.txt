Numerical pricing of American options under two stochastic factor models with jumps using a meshless local Petrov-Galerkin method

The most recent update of financial option models is American options under stochastic volatility models with jumps in returns (SVJ) and stochastic volatility models with jumps in returns and volatility (SVCJ). To evaluate these options, mesh-based methods are applied in a number of papers but it is well-known that these methods depend strongly on the mesh properties which is the major disadvantage of them. Therefore, we propose the use of the meshless methods to solve the aforementioned options models, especially in this work we select and analyze one scheme of them, named local radial point interpolation (LRPI) based on Wendland's compactly supported radial basis functions (WCS-RBFs) with C6, C4 and C2 smoothness degrees. The LRPI method which is a special type of meshless local Petrov-Galerkin method (MLPG), offers several advantages over the mesh-based methods, nevertheless it has never been applied to option pricing, at least to the very best of our knowledge. These schemes are the truly meshless methods, because, a traditional non-overlapping continuous mesh is not required, neither for the construction of the shape functions, nor for the integration of the local sub-domains. In this work, the American option which is a free boundary problem, is reduced to a problem with fixed boundary using a Richardson extrapolation technique. Then the implicit-explicit (IMEX) time stepping scheme is employed for the time derivative which allows us to smooth the discontinuities of the options' payoffs. Stability analysis of the method is analyzed and performed. In fact, according to an analysis carried out in the present paper, the proposed method is unconditionally stable. Numerical experiments are presented showing that the proposed approaches are extremely accurate and fast.
