Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping And Fast-Multipole Boundary Element Method Provide New Insights For Binaural Acoustics

This paper describes how Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) can be coupled with a Fast Multipole (FM) Boundary Element Method (BEM) to investigate the relationship between morphological changes in the head, torso, and outer ears and their acoustic filtering (described by Head Related Transfer Functions, HRTFs). The LDDMM technique provides the ability to study and implement morphological changes in ear, head and torso shapes. The FM-BEM technique provides numerical simulations of the acoustic properties of an individual's head, torso, and outer ears. This paper describes the first application of LDDMM to the study of the relationship between a listener's morphology and a listener's HRTFs. To demonstrate some of the new capabilities provided by the coupling of these powerful tools, we examine the classical question of what it means to ``listen through another individual's outer ears.'' This work utilizes the data provided by the Sydney York Morphological and Acoustic Recordings of Ears (SYMARE) database.
