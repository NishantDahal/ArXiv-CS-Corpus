Catalog Dynamics: Impact of Content Publishing and Perishing on the Performance of a LRU Cache

The Internet heavily relies on Content Distribution Networks and transparent caches to cope with the ever-increasing traffic demand of users. Content, however, is essentially versatile: once published at a given time, its popularity vanishes over time. All requests for a given document are then concentrated between the publishing time and an effective perishing time.
  In this paper, we propose a new model for the arrival of content requests, which takes into account the dynamical nature of the content catalog. Based on two large traffic traces collected on the Orange network, we use the semi-experimental method and determine invariants of the content request process. This allows us to define a simple mathematical model for content requests; by extending the so-called "Che approximation", we then compute the performance of a LRU cache fed with such a request process, expressed by its hit ratio. We numerically validate the good accuracy of our model by comparison to trace-based simulation.
