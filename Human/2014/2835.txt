Chaos Based Mixed Keystream Generation for Voice Data Encryption

In this paper, a high dimensional chaotic systems based mixed keystream generator is proposed to secure the voice data. As the voice-based communication becomes extensively vital in the application areas of military, voice over IP, voice-conferencing, phone banking, news telecasting etc. It greatly demands to preserve sensitive voice signals from the unauthorized listening and illegal usage over shared/open networks. To address the need, the designed keystream generator employed to work as a symmetric encryption technique to protect voice bitstreams over insecure transmission channel. The generator utilizes the features of high dimensional chaos like Lorenz and Chen systems to generate highly unpredictable and random-like sequences. The encryption keystream is dynamically extracted from the pre-treated chaotic mixed sequences, which are then applied to mask the voice bitstream for integrity protection of voice data. The experimental analyses like auto-correlation, signal distribution, parameter residual deviation, key space and key-sensitivity demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique for secure voice communication.
