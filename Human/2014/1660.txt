A Fast Compressive Sensing Based Digital Image Encryption Technique using Structurally Random Matrices and Arnold Transform

A new digital image encryption method based on fast compressed sensing approach using structurally random matrices and Arnold transform is proposed. Considering the natural images to be compressed in any domain, the fast compressed sensing based approach saves computational time, increases the quality of the image and reduces the dimension of the digital image by choosing even 25 % of the measurements. First, dimension reduction is utilized to compress the digital image with scrambling effect. Second, Arnold transformation is used to give the reduced digital image into more complex form. Then, the complex image is again encrypted by double random phase encoding process embedded with a host image; two random keys with fractional Fourier transform are been used as a secret keys. At the receiver, the decryption process is recovered by using TwIST algorithm. Experimental results including peak-to-peak signal-to-noise ratio between the original and reconstructed image are shown to analyze the validity of this technique and demonstrated our proposed method to be secure, fast, complex and robust.
