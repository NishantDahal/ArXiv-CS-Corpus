Turbo Compressed Sensing with Partial DFT Sensing Matrix

In this letter, we propose a turbo compressed sensing algorithm with partial discrete Fourier transform (DFT) sensing matrices. Interestingly, the state evolution of the proposed algorithm is shown to be consistent with that derived using the replica method. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the well-known approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm when a partial DFT sensing matrix is involved.
