SfePy - Write Your Own FE Application

SfePy (Simple Finite Elements in Python) is a framework for solving various kinds of problems (mechanics, physics, biology, ...) described by partial differential equations in two or three space dimensions by the finite element method. The paper illustrates its use in an interactive environment or as a framework for building custom finite-element based solvers.
