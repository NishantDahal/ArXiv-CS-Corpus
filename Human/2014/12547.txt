Six Constructions of Difference Families

In this paper, six constructions of difference families are presented. These constructions make use of difference sets, almost difference sets and disjoint difference families, and give new point of views of relationships among these combinatorial objects. Most of the constructions work for all finite groups. Though these constructions look simple, they produce many difference families with new parameters. In addition to the six new constructions, new results about intersection numbers are also derived.
