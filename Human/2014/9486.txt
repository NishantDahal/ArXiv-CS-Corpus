The Scheme of a Novel Methodology for Zonal Division Based on Power Transfer Distribution Factors

One of the methodologies that carry out the division of the electrical grid into zones is based on the aggregation of nodes characterized by similar Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDFs). Here, we point out that satisfactory clustering algorithm should take into account two aspects. First, nodes of similar impact on cross-border lines should be grouped together. Second, cross-border power flows should be relatively insensitive to differences between real and assumed Generation Shift Key matrices. We introduce a theoretical basis of a novel clustering algorithm (BubbleClust) that fulfills these requirements and we perform a case study to illustrate social welfare consequences of the division.
