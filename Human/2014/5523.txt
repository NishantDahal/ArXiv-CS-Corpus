The Eve of 3D Printing in Telemedicine: State of the Art and Future Challenges

3D printing has raised a lot of attention from fields outside the manufacturing one in the last years. In this paper, we will illustrate some recent advances of 3D printing technology, applied to the field of telemedicine and remote patient care. The potentiality of this technology will be detailed without lab examples. Some crucial aspect such as the regulation of these devices and the need of some standards will also be discussed. The purpose of this paper is to present some of the most promising applications of such technology.
