On Detecting Messaging Abuse in Short Text Messages using Linguistic and Behavioral patterns

The use of short text messages in social media and instant messaging has become a popular communication channel during the last years. This rising popularity has caused an increment in messaging threats such as spam, phishing or malware as well as other threats. The processing of these short text message threats could pose additional challenges such as the presence of lexical variants, SMS-like contractions or advanced obfuscations which can degrade the performance of traditional filtering solutions. By using a real-world SMS data set from a large telecommunications operator from the US and a social media corpus, in this paper we analyze the effectiveness of machine learning filters based on linguistic and behavioral patterns in order to detect short text spam and abusive users in the network. We have also explored different ways to deal with short text message challenges such as tokenization and entity detection by using text normalization and substring clustering techniques. The obtained results show the validity of the proposed solution by enhancing baseline approaches.
