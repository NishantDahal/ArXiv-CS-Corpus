Solving the Tower of Hanoi with Random Moves

We prove the exact formulae for the expected number of moves to solve several variants of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 3 pegs and n disks, when each move is chosen uniformly randomly from the set of all valid moves. We further present an alternative proof for one of the formulae that couples a theorem about expected commute times of random walks on graphs with the delta-to-wye transformation used in the analysis of three-phase AC systems for electrical power distribution.
