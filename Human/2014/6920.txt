Tight Bounds for Complementing Parity Automata

We follow a connection between tight determinisation and complementation and establish a complementation procedure from parity automata to nondeterministic BÃ¼chi automata and prove it to be tight up to an $O(n)$ factor, where $n$ is the size of the nondeterministic parity automaton. This factor does not depend on the number of priorities.
