Improved Estimation of the Spectral Efficiency Versus Energy-Per-Bit Tradeoff in the Wideband Regime

In this paper, a new lower bound on spectral efficiency in the low-power wideband regime is derived and utilized to develop an improved estimate of the behavior of spectral efficiency above but in the vicinity of the Shannon limit.
