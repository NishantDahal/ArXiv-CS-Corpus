Efficient Truss Maintenance in Evolving Networks

Truss was proposed to study social network data represented by graphs. A k-truss of a graph is a cohesive subgraph, in which each edge is contained in at least k-2 triangles within the subgraph. While truss has been demonstrated as superior to model the close relationship in social networks and efficient algorithms for finding trusses have been extensively studied, very little attention has been paid to truss maintenance. However, most social networks are evolving networks. It may be infeasible to recompute trusses from scratch from time to time in order to find the up-to-date $k$-trusses in the evolving networks. In this paper, we discuss how to maintain trusses in a graph with dynamic updates. We first discuss a set of properties on maintaining trusses, then propose algorithms on maintaining trusses on edge deletions and insertions, finally, we discuss truss index maintenance. We test the proposed techniques on real datasets. The experiment results show the promise of our work.
