Understanding the Mechanics of Some Localized Protocols by Theory of Complex Networks

In the study of ad hoc sensor networks, clustering plays an important role in energy conservation therefore analyzing the mechanics of such topology can be helpful to make logistic decisions .Using the theory of complex network the topological model is extended, where we account for the probability of preferential attachment and anti preferential attachment policy of sensor nodes to analyze the formation of clusters and calculate the probability of clustering. The theoretical analysis is conducted to determine nature of topology and quantify some of the observed facts during the execution of topology control protocols. The quantification of the observed facts leads to the alternative understanding of the energy efficiency of the routing protocols.
