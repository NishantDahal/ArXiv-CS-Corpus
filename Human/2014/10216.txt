Efficient Soft-Input Soft-Output MIMO Chase Detectors for arbitrary number of streams

We present novel soft-input soft-output (SISO) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detectors based on the Chase detection principle [1] in the context of iterative and decoding (IDD). The proposed detector complexity is linear in the signal modulation constellation size and the number of spatial streams. Two variants of the SISO detector are developed, referred to as SISO B-Chase and SISO L-Chase. An efficient method is presented that uses the decoder output to modulate the signal constellation decision boundaries inside the detector leading to the SISO detector architecture. The performance of these detectors significantly improves with just a few number of IDD iterations. The effect of transmit and receive antenna correlation is simulated. For the high-correlation case, the superiority of SISO B-Chase over the SISO L-Chase is demonstrated.
