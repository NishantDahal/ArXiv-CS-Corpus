League Championship Algorithm Based Job Scheduling Scheme for Infrastructure as a Service Cloud

League Championship Algorithm (LCA) is a sports-inspired population based algorithmic framework for global optimization over a continuous search space first proposed by Ali Husseinzadeh Kashan in the year 2009. A common characteristic between all population based optimization algorithms similar to the LCA is that, they attemt to move a population of achievable solutions to potential areas of the search space during optimization. In this paper, we proposed a job scheduling algorithm based on the L CA optimization technique for the infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud. Three other established algorithms i.e. First Come First Served (FCFS), Last Job First (LJF) and Best Effort First (BEF) were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. All four algorithms assumed to be non-preemptive. The parameters used for this experiment are the average response time and the average completion time. The results obtained shows that, LCA scheduling algorithm perform moderately better than the other algorithms as the number of virtual machines increases.
