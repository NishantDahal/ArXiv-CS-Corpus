Speed-scaling with no Preemptions

We revisit the non-preemptive speed-scaling problem, in which a set of jobs have to be executed on a single or a set of parallel speed-scalable processor(s) between their release dates and deadlines so that the energy consumption to be minimized. We adopt the speed-scaling mechanism first introduced in [Yao et al., FOCS 1995] according to which the power dissipated is a convex function of the processor's speed. Intuitively, the higher is the speed of a processor, the higher is the energy consumption. For the single-processor case, we improve the best known approximation algorithm by providing a $(1+ε)^α\tilde{B}_α$-approximation algorithm, where $\tilde{B}_α$ is a generalization of the Bell number. For the multiprocessor case, we present an approximation algorithm of ratio $\tilde{B}_α((1+ε)(1+\frac{w_{\max}}{w_{\min}}))^α$ improving the best known result by a factor of $(\frac{5}{2})^{α-1}(\frac{w_{\max}}{w_{\min}})^α$. Notice that our result holds for the fully heterogeneous environment while the previous known result holds only in the more restricted case of parallel processors with identical power functions.
