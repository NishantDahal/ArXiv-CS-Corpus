Simulation of Collision Resistant Secure Sum Protocol

secure multi-party computation is widely studied area in computer science. It is touching all most every aspect of human life. This paper demonstrates theoretical and experimental results of one of the secure multi-party computation protocols proposed by Shukla et al. implemented using visual C++. Data outflow probability is computed by changing parameters. At the end, time and space complexity is calculated using theoretical and experimental results.
