Connective eccentric index of some graph operations

The connective eccentric index of a graph is a topological index involving degrees and eccentricities of vertices of the graph. In this paper, we have studied the connective eccentric index for double graph and double cover. Also we give the connective eccentric index for some graph operations such as joins, symmetric difference, disjunction and splice of graphs.
