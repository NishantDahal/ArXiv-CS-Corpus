Procedural and Non-Procedural Implementation of Search Strategies in Control Network Programming

This report presents the general picture of how Control Network Programming can be effectively used for implementing various search strategies, both blind and informed. An interesting possibility is non - procedural solutions that can be developed for most local search algorithms. A generic solution is described for procedural implementations.
