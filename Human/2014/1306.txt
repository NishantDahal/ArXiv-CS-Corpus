Construction of minimal non-abelian left group codes

Algorithms to construct minimal left group codes are provided. These are based on results describing a complete set of orthogonal primitive idempotents in each Wedderburn component of a semisimple finite group algebra FG for a large class of groups G.
  As an illustration of our methods, alternative constructions to some best linear codes over F_2 and F_3 are given.
