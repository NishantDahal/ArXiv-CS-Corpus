Crypto multi tenant: an environment of secure computing using cloud sql

In our proposed work we mainly focus on data security of tenants so that only the authorized user can access the data. To provide this feature we use encryption and decryption process of data so that the only legal tenant can access their particular data. Hence, for security related to data of tenants we implement AES (advanced encryption standard) using cloud SQL. The result obtained from experimental methodology proved that AES gives protection for the data stored in the cloud. We make use of AES algorithm and Google App Engine to supply secured data storage, efficiency, assure availability in the condition of cloud denial-of-service attacks and data security in the cloud. This Approach is basically implemented by tenants who are going to store their data in the cloud.
