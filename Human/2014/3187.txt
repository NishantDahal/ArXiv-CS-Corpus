Quantum secret sharing based on local distinguishability

In this paper we analyze the (im)possibility of the exact distinguishability of orthogonal multipartite entangled states under {\em restricted local operation and classical communication}. Based on this local distinguishability analysis we propose a new scheme for quantum secret sharing (QSS). Our QSS scheme is quite general and cost efficient compared to other schemes. In our scheme no joint quantum operation is needed to reconstruct the secret. We also present an interesting $(2,n)$-threshold QSS scheme, where any two cooperating players, one from each of two disjoint groups of players, can always reconstruct the secret. This QSS scheme is quite uncommon, as most $(k,n)$-threshold schemes have the restriction $k\geq\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$.
