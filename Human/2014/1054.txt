Intuitionistic Fuzzy Linear Transformations

In this paper, we discussed about the intuitionistic fuzzy linear transformations (IFLT) and shown that the set of all linear transformations L(V) defined over an intuitionistic fuzzy vector space V does not form an vector space. Here we determine the unique intuitionistic fuzzy matrix associated with an intuitionistic fuzzy linear transformation with respect to an ordered standard basis for an intuitionistic fuzzy vector space. We introduced the concept of the inverse of an IFLT.
