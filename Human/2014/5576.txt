Implementation And Performance Evaluation Of Background Subtraction Algorithms

The study evaluates three background subtraction techniques. The techniques ranges from very basic algorithm to state of the art published techniques categorized based on speed, memory requirements and accuracy. Such a review can effectively guide the designer to select the most suitable method for a given application in a principled way. The algorithms used in the study ranges from varying levels of accuracy and computational complexity. Few of them can also deal with real time challenges like rain, snow, hails, swaying branches, objects overlapping, varying light intensity or slow moving objects.
