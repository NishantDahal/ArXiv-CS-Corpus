Groupoid Semantics for Thermal Computing

A groupoid semantics is presented for systems with both logical and thermal degrees of freedom. We apply this to a syntactic model for encryption, and obtain an algebraic characterization of the heat produced by the encryption function, as predicted by Landauer's principle. Our model has a linear representation theory that reveals an underlying quantum semantics, giving for the first time a functorial classical model for quantum teleportation and other quantum phenomena.
