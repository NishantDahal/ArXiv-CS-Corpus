MuSA: Multivariate Sampling Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks

A wireless sensor network can be used to collect and process environmental data, which is often of multivariate nature. This work proposes a multivariate sampling algorithm based on component analysis techniques in wireless sensor networks. To improve the sampling, the algorithm uses component analysis techniques to rank the data. Once ranked, the most representative data is retained. Simulation results show that our technique reduces the data keeping its representativeness. In addition, the energy consumption and delay to deliver the data on the network are reduced.
