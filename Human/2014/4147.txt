Transmit Pulse Shaping for Molecular Communications

This paper presents a method for shaping the transmit pulse of a molecular signal such that the diffusion channel's response is a sharp pulse. The impulse response of a diffusion channel is typically characterised as having an infinitely long transient response. This can cause severe inter-symbol-interference, and reduce the achievable reliable bit rate. We achieve the desired chemical channel response by poisoning the channel with a secondary compound, such that it chemically cancels aspects of the primary information signal. We use two independent methods to show that the chemical concentration of the \emph{information signal} should be $\propto Î´(t)$ and that of the \emph{poison signal} should be $\propto t^{-3/2}$.
