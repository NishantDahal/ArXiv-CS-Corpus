Inventions on Adaptable Menu: A TRIZ based analysis

The menu is one of the most widely used elements of a graphical user interface. The objective of a menu system is to provide various commands and functions to the user in an easy way so that the user can just select the desired operation from a given list instead of typing a complex command in the command prompt.
  In a conventional menu system the menu items or options are hard-coded in the computer program. The programmer or developer composes menu items at the time of development. The developer tries to include all options that he feels may be required by the user in future. Although the items are decided from "requirement analysis" and other studies, it is difficult to know the exact need of a user at a future period of time. This leads to inclusion of a lot of items in the menu, which leads to user confusion and frustration.
  Thus there is a need for adaptable menu that can be changed according to user requirement. The items of the adaptable menu should change from user to user and from time to time depending on the program context and likelihood of user selection.
  This article defines the Ideal Final Result of a dropdown menu system, defines the desirable functions of an adaptable menu, finds and solves the contradictions faced in achieving the desirable functions, and illustrates six selected cases on adaptable menu from US patent database.
