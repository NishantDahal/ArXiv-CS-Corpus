Entropy and its discontents: A note on definitions

The routine definitions of both entropy, and differential entropy show inconsistencies that make them not reciprocally coherent. We propose a few possible modifications of these quantities so that 1) they no longer show incongruities, 2) they go one into the other in a suitable limit as the result of a renormalization. The properties of the new quantities would slightly differ from that of the usual entropies in a few other respects
