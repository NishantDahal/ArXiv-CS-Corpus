Performance Analysis on The Basis of a Comparative Study Between Multipath Rayleigh Fading And AWGN Channel in The Presence of Various Interference

Interference is the most important issue for present wireless communication. There are various kinds of channel used in wireless communication. Here I want to show a performance analysis on the basis of two different channels - AWGN and Multipath Rayleigh fading channel. This is the comparative analysis with different kinds of modulation techniques. Here I have also measured the Bit Error Rate with respect to different modulation techniques and compare the rate in different channels. My objective is to compare the different characteristics of the transmitter and receiver for different types of channels and modulators.
