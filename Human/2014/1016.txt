Constraint Solvers for User Interface Layout

Constraints have played an important role in the construction of GUIs, where they are mainly used to define the layout of the widgets. Resizing behavior is very important in GUIs because areas have domain specific parameters such as form the resizing of windows. If linear objective function is used and window is resized then error is not distributed equally. To distribute the error equally, a quadratic objective function is introduced. Different algorithms are widely used for solving linear constraints and quadratic problems in a variety of different scientific areas. The linear relxation, Kaczmarz, direct and linear programming methods are common methods for solving linear constraints for GUI layout. The interior point and active set methods are most commonly used techniques to solve quadratic programming problems. Current constraint solvers designed for GUI layout do not use interior point methods for solving a quadratic objective function subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. In this paper, performance aspects and the convergence speed of interior point and active set methods are compared along with one most commonly used linear programming method when they are implemented for graphical user interface layout. The performance and convergence of the proposed algorithms are evaluated empirically using randomly generated UI layout specifications of various sizes. The results show that the interior point algorithms perform significantly better than the Simplex method and QOCA-solver, which uses the active set method implementation for solving quadratic optimization.
