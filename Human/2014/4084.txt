Using industrial robot to manipulate the measured object in CMM

Coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) are widely used to check dimensions of manufactured parts, especially in automotive industry. The major obstacles in automation of these measurements are fixturing and clamping assemblies, which are required in order to position the measured object within the CMM. This paper describes how an industrial robot can be used to manipulate the measured object within the CMM work space, in order to enable automation of complex geometry measurement.
