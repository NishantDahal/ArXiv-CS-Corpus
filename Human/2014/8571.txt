Computerized Multi Microphone Test System

An acoustic testing approach based on the concept of a microphone sensor surrounding the product under test is proposed. Microphone signals are processed simultaneously by a test system computer, according to the objective of the test. The spatial and frequency domain selectivity features of this method are examined. Sound-spatial visualization algorithm is observed. A test system design based on the concept of a microphone surrounding the tested product has the potential to improve distortion measurement accuracy.
