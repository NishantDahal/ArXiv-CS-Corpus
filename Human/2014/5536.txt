Evaluation The Efficiency Of Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm

In this paper a new evolutionary algorithm, for continuous nonlinear optimization problems, is surveyed. This method is inspired by the life of a bird, called Cuckoo. The Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA) is evaluated by using the Rastrigin function. The problem is a non-linear continuous function which is used for evaluating optimization algorithms. The efficiency of the COA has been studied by obtaining optimal solution of various dimensions Rastrigin function in this paper. The mentioned function also was solved by FA and ABC algorithms. Comparing the results shows the COA has better performance than other algorithms. Application of algorithm to test function has proven its capability to deal with difficult optimization problems.
