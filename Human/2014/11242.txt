Formative Assessment and its E-learning Implementation

Innovation in assessment is no more a choice in a tech-savvy instant age. The purpose of this study was to get more insight into the implementation of formative assessment through the e-learning tool called Black Board Learning System in our University. The proposal is to implement a series of weekly or fortnightly tests on the BB. These would have options to provide sufficient feedback as a follow up to the attempt of students. Responses from questionnaires were used to discover the important concerns in the perceptions of students on the proposed concept of continuous assessment and the BB Online test implementation. The results indicate that students support the idea mainly because they find the disintegration into small topic assessments as useful, coupled with the availability of immediate teacher feedback. What we intend is a culture of success, backed by a belief that all pupils can achieve the same.
