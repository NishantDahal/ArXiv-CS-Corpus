Modify-and-Forward for Securing Cooperative Relay Communications

We proposed a new physical layer technique that can enhance the security of cooperative relay communications. The proposed approach modifies the decoded message at the relay according to the unique channel state between the relay and the destination such that the destination can utilize the modified message to its advantage while the eavesdropper cannot. We present a practical method for securely sharing the modification rule between the legitimate partners and present the secrecy outage probability in a quasi-static fading channel. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can provide a significant improvement over other schemes when the relay can successfully decode the source message.
