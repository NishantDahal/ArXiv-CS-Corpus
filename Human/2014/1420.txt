Lightweight Self-Bootstrapping Multiparty Computations of Time-Series Data with Custom Collusion Tolerance

In this work we compare two recent multiparty computation (MPC) protocols for private summation in terms of performance. Both protocols allow multiple rounds of aggregation from the same set of public keys generated by parties in an initial stage. We instantiate the protocols with a fast elliptic curve and provide an experimental comparison of their performance for different phases of the protocol. Furthermore, we introduce a technique that allows the computational load of both protocols to be reduced at the expense of protection against collusion tolerance. We prove that both protocols remain secure with this technique, and evaluate its impact on collusion tolerance and the number of rounds supported.
