A new class of SETI beacons that contain information (22-aug-2010)

In the cm-wavelength range, an extraterrestrial electromagnetic narrow band (sine wave) beacon is an excellent choice to get alien attention across interstellar distances because 1) it is not strongly affected by interstellar / interplanetary dispersion or scattering, and 2) searching for narrowband signals is computationally efficient (scales as Ns log(Ns) where Ns = number of voltage samples). Here we consider a special case wideband signal where two or more delayed copies of the same signal are transmitted over the same frequency and bandwidth, with the result that ISM dispersion and scattering cancel out during the detection stage. Such a signal is both a good beacon (easy to find) and carries arbitrarily large information rate (limited only by the atmospheric transparency to about 10 GHz). The discovery process uses an autocorrelation algorithm, and we outline a compute scheme where the beacon discovery search can be accomplished with only 2x the processing of a conventional sine wave search, and discuss signal to background response for sighting the beacon. Once the beacon is discovered, the focus turns to information extraction. Information extraction requires similar processing as for generic wideband signal searches, but since we have already identified the beacon, the efficiency of information extraction is negligible.
