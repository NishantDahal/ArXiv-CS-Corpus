Merging and Shifting of Images with Prominence Coefficient for Predictive Analysis using Combined Image

Shifting of objects in an image and merging many images after appropriate shifting is being used in several engineering and scientific applications which require complex perception development. A method has been presented here which could be used in precision engineering and biological applications where more precise prediction is required of a combined phenomenon with varying prominence of each phenomenon. Accurate merging of intended pixels can be achieved in high quality using frequency domain techniques even though initial properties of the original pixels are lost in this process. This paper introduces a technique to shift and merge various images with varying prominence of each image. A coefficient named prominence coefficient has been introduced which is capable of making some of the images transparent and highlighting the rest as per requirement of merging process which can be used as a simple but effective technique for overlapped view of a set of images.
