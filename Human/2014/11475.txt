Algorithm engineering for a quantum annealing platform

Recent advances bring within reach the viability of solving combinatorial problems using a quantum annealing algorithm implemented on a purpose-built platform that exploits quantum properties. However, the question of how to tune the algorithm for most effective use in this framework is not well understood. In this paper we describe some operational parameters that drive performance, discuss approaches for mitigating sources of error, and present experimental results from a D-Wave Two quantum annealing processor.
