Understanding Types of Users on Twitter

People use microblogging platforms like Twitter to involve with other users for a wide range of interests and practices. Twitter profiles run by different types of users such as humans, bots, spammers, businesses and professionals. This research work identifies six broad classes of Twitter users, and employs a supervised machine learning approach which uses a comprehensive set of features to classify users into the identified classes. For this purpose, we exploit users' profile and tweeting behavior information. We evaluate our approach by performing 10-fold cross validation using manually annotated 716 different Twitter profiles. High classification accuracy (measured using AUC, and precision, recall) reveals the significance of the proposed approach.
