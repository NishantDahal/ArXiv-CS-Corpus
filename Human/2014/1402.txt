Comparative analysis of common edge detection techniques in context of object extraction

Edges characterize boundaries and are therefore a problem of practical importance in remote sensing.In this paper a comparative study of various edge detection techniques and band wise analysis of these algorithms in the context of object extraction with regard to remote sensing satellite images from the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) sensors LISS 3, LISS 4 and Cartosat1 as well as Google Earth is presented.
