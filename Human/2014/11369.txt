Compute-and-Forward: Finding the Best Equation

Compute-and-Forward is an emerging technique to deal with interference. It allows the receiver to decode a suitably chosen integer linear combination of the transmitted messages. The integer coefficients should be adapted to the channel fading state. Optimizing these coefficients is a Shortest Lattice Vector (SLV) problem. In general, the SLV problem is known to be prohibitively complex. In this paper, we show that the particular SLV instance resulting from the Compute-and-Forward problem can be solved in low polynomial complexity and give an explicit deterministic algorithm that is guaranteed to find the optimal solution.
