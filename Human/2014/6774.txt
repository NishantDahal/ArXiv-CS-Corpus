Rescue Robotics in Bore well Environment

A technique for rescue task in bore well environment has been proposed. India is facing a distressed cruel situation where in the previous years a number of child deaths have been reported falling in the bore well. As the diameter of the bore well is quiet narrow for any adult person and the lights goes dark inside it, the rescue task in those situations is a challenging task. Here we are proposing a robotic system which will attach a harness to the child using pneumatic arms for picking up. A teleconferencing system will also be attached to the robot for communicating with the child.
