First steps to Virtual Mammography: Simulating external compressions of the breast with the Surface Evolver

In this paper we introduce a computational modelling that reproduces the breast compression processes used to obtain the mammogram. The main result is a programme in which one can track the first steps of virtual mammography. On the one hand, our modelling enables addition of structures that represent different tissues, muscles and glands in the breast. On the other hand, we shall validate and implement it by means of laboratory tests with phantoms. To the best of our knowledge, these two characteristics do confer originality to our research. This is because their interrelation seems not to be properly established elsewhere yet. We conclude that our model reproduces the same shapes and measurements really taken from the volunteer's breasts.
