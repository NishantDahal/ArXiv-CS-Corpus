Use of Dynamical Systems Modeling to Hybrid Cloud Database

In the article, an experiment is aimed at clarifying the transfer efficiency of the database in the cloud infrastructure. The system was added to the control unit, which has guided the database search in the local part or in the cloud. It is shown that the time data acquisition remains unchanged as a result of modification. Suggestions have been made about the use of the theory of dynamic systems to hybrid cloud database. The present work is aimed at attracting the attention of spe-cialists in the field of cloud database to the apparatus control theory. The experiment presented in this article allows the use of the description of the known methods for solving important practical problems.
