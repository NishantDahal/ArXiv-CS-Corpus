A Comparative study Between Fuzzy Clustering Algorithm and Hard Clustering Algorithm

Data clustering is an important area of data mining. This is an unsupervised study where data of similar types are put into one cluster while data of another types are put into different cluster. Fuzzy C means is a very important clustering technique based on fuzzy logic. Also we have some hard clustering techniques available like K-means among the popular ones. In this paper a comparative study is done between Fuzzy clustering algorithm and hard clustering algorithm
