Lattice-Based Ring Signature Scheme under the Random Oracle Model

On the basis of the signatures scheme without trapdoors from lattice, which is proposed by Vadim Lyubashevsky in 2012, we present a new ring signature scheme from lattice. The proposed ring signature scheme is an extension of the signatures scheme without trapdoors. We proved that our scheme is strongly unforgeable against adaptive chosen message in the random oracle model, and proved that the security of our scheme can be reduced to the hardness of the small integer solution (SIS) problem by rejection samplings. Compared with the existing lattice-based ring signature schemes, our new scheme is more efficient and with shorter signature length.
