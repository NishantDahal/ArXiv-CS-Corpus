Algorithms for distance problems in planar complexes of global nonpositive curvature

CAT(0) metric spaces and hyperbolic spaces play an important role in combinatorial and geometric group theory. In this paper, we present efficient algorithms for distance problems in CAT(0) planar complexes. First of all, we present an algorithm for answering single-point distance queries in a CAT(0) planar complex. Namely, we show that for a CAT(0) planar complex K with n vertices, one can construct in O(n^2 log n) time a data structure D of size O(n^2) so that, given a point x in K, the shortest path gamma(x,y) between x and the query point y can be computed in linear time. Our second algorithm computes the convex hull of a finite set of points in a CAT(0) planar complex. This algorithm is based on Toussaint's algorithm for computing the convex hull of a finite set of points in a simple polygon and it constructs the convex hull of a set of k points in O(n^2 log n + nk log k) time, using a data structure of size O(n^2 + k).
