Deep Regression for Face Alignment

In this paper, we present a deep regression approach for face alignment. The deep architecture consists of a global layer and multi-stage local layers. We apply the back-propagation algorithm with the dropout strategy to jointly optimize the regression parameters. We show that the resulting deep regressor gradually and evenly approaches the true facial landmarks stage by stage, avoiding the tendency to yield over-strong early stage regressors while over-weak later stage regressors. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
