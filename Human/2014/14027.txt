Towards a graphical language for quadrotor missions

This paper presents an approach for defining Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) missions on a high level. Current methods for UAV mission specification are evaluated and their deficiencies are analyzed. From these findings, a new graphical specification language for UAV missions is proposed, which is targeted towards typical UAV users from various domains rather than computer science experts. The research is ongoing, but a first prototype is presented.
