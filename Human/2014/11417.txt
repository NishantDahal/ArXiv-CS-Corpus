Duality for Modules and Applications to Decoding Linear Codes over Finite Commutative Rings

Using linear functional-based duality of modules, we generalize the syndrome decoding algorithm of linear codes over finite fields to those over finite commutative rings. Moreover, If the ring is local the algorithm is simplified by introducing the control matrix.
