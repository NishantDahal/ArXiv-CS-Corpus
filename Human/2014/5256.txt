Efficient Tracking of a Moving Object using Inter-Frame Coding

Video surveillance has long been in use to monitor security sensitive areas such as banks, department stores, highways, crowded public places and borders.The advance in computing power, availability of large-capacity storage devices and high speed network infrastructure paved the way for cheaper, multi-sensor video surveillance systems.Traditionally, the video outputs are processed online by human operators and are usually saved to tapes for later use only after a forensic event.The increase in the number of cameras in ordinary surveillance systems overloaded both the human operators and the storage devices with high volumes of data and made it in-feasible to ensure proper monitoring of sensitive areas for long times.
