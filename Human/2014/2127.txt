Stability and Performance Issues of a Relay Assisted Multiple Access Scheme with MPR Capabilities

In this work, we study the impact of a relay node to a network with a finite number of users-sources and a destination node. We assume that the users have saturated queues and the relay node does not have packets of its own; we have random access of the medium and the time is slotted. The relay node stores a source packet that it receives successfully in its queue when the transmission to the destination node has failed. The relay and the destination nodes have multi-packet reception capabilities. We obtain analytical equations for the characteristics of the relay's queue such as average queue length, stability conditions etc. We also study the throughput per user and the aggregate throughput for the network.
