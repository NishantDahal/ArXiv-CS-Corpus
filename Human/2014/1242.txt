On the Significance of Self-Justifying Axiom Systems from the Perspective of Analytic Tableaux

This article will be a continuation of our research into self-justifying systems. It will introduce several new theorems and their applications. (One of these results will transform our previous infinite-sized self-verifying formalisms into tighter systems, with only a finite number of axioms.) It will explain how self-justification is useful, even when the Incompleteness Theorem limits its reach.
