A Generalization of the Łoś-Tarski Preservation Theorem over Classes of Finite Structures

We investigate a generalization of the Łoś-Tarski preservation theorem via the semantic notion of \emph{preservation under substructures modulo $k$-sized cores}. It was shown earlier that over arbitrary structures, this semantic notion for first-order logic corresponds to definability by $\exists^k\forall^*$ sentences. In this paper, we identify two properties of classes of finite structures that ensure the above correspondence. The first is based on well-quasi-ordering under the embedding relation. The second is a logic-based combinatorial property that strictly generalizes the first. We show that starting with classes satisfying any of these properties, the classes obtained by applying operations like disjoint union, cartesian and tensor products, or by forming words and trees over the classes, inherit the same property. As a fallout, we obtain interesting classes of structures over which an effective version of the Łoś-Tarski theorem holds.
