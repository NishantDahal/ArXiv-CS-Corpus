Taking A Free Ride for Routing Topology Inference in Peer-to-Peer Networks

A Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network can boost its performance if peers are provided with underlying network-layer routing topology. The task of inferring the network-layer routing topology and link performance from an end host to a set of other hosts is termed as network tomography, and it normally requires host computers to send probing messages. We design a passive network tomography method that does not requires any probing messages and takes a free ride over data flows in P2P networks. It infers routing topology based on end-to-end delay correlation estimation (DCE) without requiring any synchronization or cooperation from the intermediate routers. We implement and test our method in the real world Internet environment and achieved the accuracy of 92% in topology recovery. We also perform extensive simulation in OMNet++ to evaluate its performance over large scale networks, showing that its topology recovery accuracy is about 95% for large networks.
