Modeling Creativity: Case Studies in Python

Modeling Creativity (doctoral dissertation, 2013) explores how creativity can be represented using computational approaches. Our aim is to construct computer models that exhibit creativity in an artistic context, that is, that are capable of generating or evaluating an artwork (visual or linguistic), an interesting new idea, a subjective opinion. The research was conducted in 2008-2012 at the Computational Linguistics Research Group (CLiPS, University of Antwerp) under the supervision of Prof. Walter Daelemans. Prior research was also conducted at the Experimental Media Research Group (EMRG, St. Lucas University College of Art & Design Antwerp) under the supervision of Lucas Nijs.
  Modeling Creativity examines creativity in a number of different perspectives: from its origins in nature, which is essentially blind, to humans and machines, and from generating creative ideas to evaluating and learning their novelty and usefulness. We will use a hands-on approach with case studies and examples in the Python programming language.
