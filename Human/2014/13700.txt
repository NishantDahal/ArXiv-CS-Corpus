Analysis of Optimal Recombination in Genetic Algorithm for a Scheduling Problem with Setups

In this paper, we perform an experimental study of optimal recombination operator for makespan minimization problem on single machine with sequence-dependent setup times ($1|s_{vu}|C_{\max}$). The computational experiment on benchmark problems from TSPLIB library indicates practical applicability of optimal recombination in crossover operator of genetic algorithm for $1|s_{vu}|C_{\max}$.
