A Guide To Deal With Uncertainties In Software Project Management

Various project management approaches do not consider the impact that uncertainties have on the project. The identified threats by uncertainty in a projec day-to-day are real and immediate and the expectations in a project are often high. The project manager faces a dilemma: decisions must be made in the present about future situations which are inherently uncertain. The use of uncertainty management in project can be a determining factor for the project success. This paper presents a systematic review about uncertainties management in software projects and a guide is proposed based on the review. It aims to present the best practices to manage uncertainties in software projects in a structured way including techniques and strategies to uncertainties containment.
