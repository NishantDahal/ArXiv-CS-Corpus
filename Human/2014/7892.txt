Numerical investigation of lensless zoomable holographic multiple projections to tilted planes

This paper numerically investigates the feasibility of lensless zoomable holographic multiple projections to tilted planes. We have already developed lensless zoomable holographic single projection using scaled diffraction, which calculates diffraction between parallel planes with different sampling pitches. The structure of this zoomable holographic projection is very simple because it does not need a lens; however, it only projects a single image to a plane parallel to the hologram. The lensless zoomable holographic projection in this paper is capable of projecting multiple images onto tilted planes simultaneously.
