A Message-Passing Approach to Combating Hidden Terminals in Wireless Networks

Collisions with hidden terminals is a major cause of performance degradation in 802.11 and likewise wireless networks. Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) is utilized to avoid collisions at the cost of spatial reuse. This report studies receiver design to mitigate interference from hidden terminals. A wireless channel model with correlated fading in time is assumed. A message-passing approach is proposed, in which a receiver can successfully receive and decode partially overlapping transmissions from two sources rather than treating undesired one as thermal noise. Numerical results of both coded and uncoded systems show the advantage of the receiver over conventional receivers.
