An Educational Fuzzy-based Control platform using LEGO Robots

Fuzzy controllers have gained popularity in the past few decades with successful implementations in many fields that have enabled designers to control complex systems through linguistic-based rules in contrast to traditional methods. This paper presents an educational platform based on LEGO\c{opyright} NXT to assist the learning of fuzzy logic control principles at undergraduate level by providing a simple and easy-to-follow teaching setup. The proposed fuzzy control study aims to accompany students to the learning of fuzzy control fundamentals by building hands-on robotic experiments. The proposed educational platform has been successfully applied to several undergraduate courses within the Electronics Department in the University of Guadalajara. The description of robotic experiments and the evaluation of their impact in the student performance are both provided in the paper.
