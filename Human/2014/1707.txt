Effects of Easy Hybrid Parallelization with CUDA for Numerical-Atomic-Orbital Density Functional Theory Calculation

We modified a MPI-friendly density functional theory (DFT) source code within hybrid parallelization including CUDA. Our objective is to find out how simple conversions within the hybrid parallelization with mid-range GPUs affect DFT code not originally suitable to CUDA. We settled several rules of hybrid parallelization for numerical-atomic-orbital (NAO) DFT codes. The test was performed on a magnetite material system with OpenMX code by utilizing a hardware system containing 2 Xeon E5606 CPUs and 2 Quadro 4000 GPUs. 3-way hybrid routines obtained a speedup of 7.55 while 2-way hybrid speedup by 10.94. GPUs with CUDA complement the efficiency of OpenMP and compensate CPUs' excessive competition within MPI.
