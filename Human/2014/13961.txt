Framework for Wireless Network Security using Quantum Cryptography

Data that is transient over an unsecured wireless network is always susceptible to being intercepted by anyone within the range of the wireless signal. Hence providing secure communication to keep the user information and devices safe when connected wirelessly has become one of the major concerns. Quantum cryptography provides a solution towards absolute communication security over the network by encoding information as polarized photons, which can be sent through the air. This paper explores on the aspect of application of quantum cryptography in wireless networks. In this paper we present a methodology for integrating quantum cryptography and security of IEEE 802.11 wireless networks in terms of distribution of the encryption keys.
