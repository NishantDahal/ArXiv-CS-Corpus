Onboard Dynamic Rail Track Safety Monitoring System

This proposal aims at solving one of the long prevailing problems in the Indian Railways. This simple method of continuous monitoring and assessment of the condition of the rail tracks can prevent major disasters and save precious human lives. Our method is capable of alerting the train in case of any dislocations in the track or change in strength of the soil. Also it can avert the collisions of the train with other or with the vehicles trying to move across the unmanned level crossings.
