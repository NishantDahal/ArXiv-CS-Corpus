Energy-Efficient Strategies for Cooperative Multi-Channel MAC Protocols

Distributed Information SHaring (DISH) is a new cooperative approach to designing multi-channel MAC protocols. It aids nodes in their decision making processes by compensating for their missing information via information sharing through other neighboring nodes. This approach was recently shown to significantly boost the throughput of multi-channel MAC protocols. However, a critical issue for ad hoc communication devices, i.e., energy efficiency, has yet to be addressed. In this paper, we address this issue by developing simple solutions which (1) reduce the energy consumption (2) without compromising the throughput performance, and meanwhile (3) maximize cost efficiency. We propose two energy-efficient strategies: in-situ energy conscious DISH which uses existing nodes only, and altruistic DISH which needs additional nodes called altruists. We compare five protocols with respect to the strategies and identify altruistic DISH to be the right choice in general: it (1) conserves 40-80% of energy, (2) maintains the throughput advantage gained from the DISH approach, and (3) more than doubles the cost efficiency compared to protocols without applying the strategy. On the other hand, our study shows that in-situ energy conscious DISH is suitable only in certain limited scenarios.
