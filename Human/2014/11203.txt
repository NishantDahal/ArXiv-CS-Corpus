Axiomatizing Propositional Dependence Logics

We give sound and complete Hilbert-style axiomatizations for propositional dependence logic (PD), modal dependence logic (MDL), and extended modal dependence logic (EMDL) by extending existing axiomatizations for propositional logic and modal logic. In addition, we give novel labeled tableau calculi for PD, MDL, and EMDL. We prove soundness, completeness and termination for each of the labeled calculi.
