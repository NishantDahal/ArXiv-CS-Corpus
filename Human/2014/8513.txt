Identifiability of multivariate logistic mixture models

Mixture models have been widely used in modeling of continuous observations. For the possibility to estimate the parameters of a mixture model consistently on the basis of observations from the mixture, identifiability is a necessary condition. In this study, we give some results on the identifiability of multivariate logistic mixture models.
