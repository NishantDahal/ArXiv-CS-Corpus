Audio Splicing Detection and Localization Using Environmental Signature

Audio splicing is one of the most common manipulation techniques in the area of audio forensics. In this paper, the magnitudes of acoustic channel impulse response and ambient noise are proposed as the environmental signature. Specifically, the spliced audio segments are detected according to the magnitude correlation between the query frames and reference frames via a statically optimal threshold. The detection accuracy is further refined by comparing the adjacent frames. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on two data sets. One is generated from TIMIT database, and the other one is made in four acoustic environments using a commercial grade microphones. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only detects the presence of spliced frames, but also localizes the forgery segments with near perfect accuracy. Comparison results illustrate that the identification accuracy of the proposed scheme is higher than the previous schemes. In addition, experimental results also show that the proposed scheme is robust to MP3 compression attack, which is also superior to the previous works.
