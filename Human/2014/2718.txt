Resolution in Linguistic First Order Logic based on Linear Symmetrical Hedge Algebra

This paper focuses on resolution in linguistic first order logic with truth value taken from linear symmetrical hedge algebra. We build the basic components of linguistic first order logic, including syntax and semantics. We present a resolution principle for our logic to resolve on two clauses having contradictory linguistic truth values. Since linguistic information is uncertain, inference in our linguistic logic is approximate. Therefore, we introduce the concept of reliability in order to capture the natural approximation of the resolution inference rule.
