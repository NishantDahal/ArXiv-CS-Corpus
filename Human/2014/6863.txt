Proceedings Twelfth International Workshop on Quantitative Aspects of Programming Languages and Systems

This volume contains the proceedings of the Twelfth Workshop on Quantitative Aspects of Programming Languages and Systems (QAPL 2014), held in Grenoble, France, on 12 and 13 April, 2014.  QAPL 2014 was a satellite event of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS). The central theme of the workshop is that of quantitative aspects of computation. These aspects are related to the use of physical quantities (storage space, time, bandwidth, etc.) as well as mathematical quantities (e.g. probability and measures for reliability, security and trust), and play an important (sometimes essential) role in characterising the behaviour and determining the properties of systems. Such quantities are central to the definition of both the model of systems (architecture, language design, semantics) and the methodologies and tools for the analysis and verification of the systems properties. The aim of this workshop is to discuss the explicit use of quantitative information such as time and probabilities either directly in the model or as a tool for the analysis of systems.
