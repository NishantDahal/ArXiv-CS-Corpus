Models of robotic feeding, choice, and the survival mechanism

Diagrammatic models of feeding choices reveal fundamental robotic behaviors. Successful choices are reinforced by positive feedback, while unsuccessful ones by negative feedback. This paper will address robotic feeding by casually relating consequential behavior subtended by a strong dependence upon survival.
