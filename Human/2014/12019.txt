An upper bound on Euclidean embeddings of rigid graphs with 8 vertices

A graph is called (generically) rigid in R^d if, for any choice of sufficiently generic edge lengths, it can be embedded in R^d in a finite number of distinct ways, modulo rigid transformations. Here, we deal with the problem of determining the maximum number of planar Euclidean embeddings of minimally rigid graphs with 8 vertices, because this is the smallest unknown case in the plane.
