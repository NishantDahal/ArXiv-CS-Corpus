Privacy Policy Negotiation in Social Media

Social Media involve many shared items, such as photos, which may concern more than one user. The first challenge we address in this paper is to develop a way for users of such items to take a decision on to whom to share these items. This is not an easy problem, as users' privacy preferences for the same item may conflict, so an approach that just merges in some way the users' privacy preferences may provide unsatisfactory results. We propose a negotiation mechanism for users to agree on a compromise for the conflicts found. The second challenge we address in this paper relates to the exponential complexity of such a negotiation mechanism, which could make it too slow to be used in practice in a Social Media infrastructure. To address this, we propose heuristics that reduce the complexity of the negotiation mechanism and show how substantial benefits can be derived from the use of these heuristics through extensive experimental evaluation that compares the performance of the negotiation mechanism with and without these heuristics. Moreover, we show that one such heuristic makes the negotiation mechanism produce results fast enough to be used in actual Social Media infrastructures with near-optimal results.
