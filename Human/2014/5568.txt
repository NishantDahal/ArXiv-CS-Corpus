Downlink and Uplink Decoupling: a Disruptive Architectural Design for 5G Networks

Cell association in cellular networks has traditionally been based on the downlink received signal power only, despite the fact that up and downlink transmission powers and interference levels differed significantly. This approach was adequate in homogeneous networks with macro base stations all having similar transmission power levels. However, with the growth of heterogeneous networks where there is a big disparity in the transmit power of the different base station types, this approach is highly inefficient. In this paper, we study the notion of Downlink and Uplink Decoupling (DUDe) where the downlink cell association is based on the downlink received power while the uplink is based on the pathloss. We present the motivation and assess the gains of this 5G design approach with simulations that are based on Vodafone's LTE field trial network in a dense urban area, employing a high resolution ray-tracing pathloss prediction and realistic traffic maps based on live network measurements.
