No-Sense: Sense with Dormant Sensors

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have enabled continuous monitoring of an area of interest (body, room, region, etc.) while eliminating expensive wired infrastructure. Typically in such applications, wireless sensor nodes report the sensed values to a sink node, where the information is required for the end-user. WSNs also provide the flexibility to the end-user for choosing several parameters for the monitoring application. For example, placement of sensors, frequency of sensing and transmission of those sensed data. Over the years, the advancement in embedded technology has led to increased processing power and memory capacity of these battery powered devices. However, batteries can only supply limited energy, thus limiting the lifetime of the network. In order to prolong the lifetime of the deployment, various efforts have been made to improve the battery technologies and also reduce the energy consumption of the sensor node at various layers in the networking stack. Of all the operations in the network stack, wireless data transmission and reception have found to consume most of the energy. Hence many proposals found in the literature target reducing them through intelligent schemes like power control, reducing retransmissions, etc. In this article we propose a new framework called Virtual Sensing Framework (VSF), which aims to sufficiently satisfy application requirements while conserving energy at the sensor nodes.
