Convergence of maxgeneralized mean-mingeneralized mean powers of intuitionistic fuzzy matrices

Intuitionistic fuzzy relations on finite universes can be represent by intuitionistic fuzzy matrices and the
  limiting behavior of the power matrices depends on the algebraic operation employed on the matrices. In this
  paper, the power of intuitionistic fuzzy matrices with maxgeneralized mean-mingeneralized mean operation have
  been studied. Here it is shown that the power of intuitionistic fuzzy matrices with the said operations are
  always convergent. The convergence of powers for an intuitionistic fuzzy matrix with convex combination of
  max-min and maxarithmetic mean-minarithmetic mean are also dicussed here.
