Large-Scale Fading Behavior for a Cellular Network with Uniform Spatial Distribution

Large-scale fading (LSF) between interacting nodes is a fundamental element in radio communications, responsible for weakening the propagation, and thus worsening the service quality. Given the importance of channel-losses in general, and the inevitability of random spatial geometry in real-life wireless networks, it was then natural to merge these two paradigms together in order to obtain an improved stochastical model for the LSF indicator. Therefore, in exact closed-form notation, we generically derived the LSF distribution between a prepositioned reference base-station and an arbitrary node for a multi-cellular random network model. In fact, we provided an explicit and definitive formulation that considered at once: the lattice profile, the users' random geometry, the effect of the far-field phenomenon, the path-loss behavior, and the stochastic impact of channel scatters. The veracity and accuracy of the theoretical analysis were also confirmed through Monte Carlo simulations.
