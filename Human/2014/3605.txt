On Cloud-Based Engineering of Dependable Systems

The cloud computing paradigm is being adopted by many organizations in different application domains as it is cost effective and offers a virtually unlimited pool of resources. Engineering critical systems can benefit from clouds in attaining all dependability means: fault tolerance, fault prevention, fault removal and fault forecasting. Our research aims to investigate the potential of supporting engineering of dependable software systems with cloud computing and proposes an open, extensible, and elastic cloud-based software engineering workflow system which represents and executes software processes to improve collaboration, reliability and quality assurance, and automation in software projects.
