Competition vs. Cooperation: A Game-Theoretic Decision Analysis for MIMO HetNets

This paper addresses the problem of competition vs. cooperation in the downlink, between base stations (BSs), of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) interference, heterogeneous wireless network (HetNet). This research presents a scenario where a macrocell base station (MBS) and a cochannel femtocell base station (FBS) each simultaneously serving their own user equipment (UE), has to choose to act as individual systems or to cooperate in coordinated multipoint transmission (CoMP). The paper employes both the theories of non-cooperative and cooperative games in a unified procedure to analyze the decision making process. The BSs of the competing system are assumed to operate at the\emph{}maximum expected sum rate\emph{}(MESR)\emph{}correlated equilibrium\emph{}(CE), which is compared against the value of CoMP to establish the stability of the coalition. It is proven that there exists a threshold geographical separation, $d_{\text{th}}$, between the macrocell user equipment (MUE) and FBS, under which the region of coordination is non-empty. Theoretical results are verified through simulations.
