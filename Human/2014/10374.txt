Opportunities at the Mathematics/Future Cities Interface

We make the case for mathematicians and statisticians to stake their claim in the fast-moving and high-impact research field that is becoming known as Future Cities. After assessing the Future Cities arena, we provide some illustrative challenges where mathematical scientists can make an impact.
