Bracing Heterogeneous Distributed Systems via Built-in Frameworks

This paper introduces a novel architecture of distributed systems--called framed distributed system, or FDS--that braces a given system via a built-in virtual framework that controls the flow of messages between system components and between them and their environment, while being oblivious of the code of the communicating components. This control is carried out in a decentralized, and thus scalable, manner. The FDS architecture is expected to have a significant impact on the dependability and security of distributed systems, and on the whole life cycle of such systems. Although this architecture has been designed specifically for SOA-like heterogeneous and open systems--whose components may be written in different languages, may run on different platforms, and may be designed, constructed, and even maintained under different administrative domains--it should be useful for distributed systems in general.
