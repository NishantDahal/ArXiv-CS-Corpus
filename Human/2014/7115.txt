Sparse Polynomial Interpolation Codes and their decoding beyond half the minimal distance

We present algorithms performing sparse univariate polynomial interpolation with errors in the evaluations of the polynomial. Based on the initial work by Comer, Kaltofen and Pernet [Proc. ISSAC 2012], we define the sparse polynomial interpolation codes and state that their minimal distance is precisely the length divided by twice the sparsity. At ISSAC 2012, we have given a decoding algorithm for as much as half the minimal distance and a list decoding algorithm up to the minimal distance. Our new polynomial-time list decoding algorithm uses sub-sequences of the received evaluations indexed by a linear progression, allowing the decoding for a larger radius, that is, more errors in the evaluations while returning a list of candidate sparse polynomials. We quantify this improvement for all typically small values of number of terms and number of errors, and provide a worst case asymptotic analysis of this improvement. For instance, for sparsity T = 5 with up to 10 errors we can list decode in polynomial-time from 74 values of the polynomial with unknown terms, whereas our earlier algorithm required 2T (E + 1) = 110 evaluations. We then propose two variations of these codes in characteristic zero, where appropriate choices of values for the variable yield a much larger minimal distance: the length minus twice the sparsity.
