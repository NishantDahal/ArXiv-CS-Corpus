A note on the sum-rate-distortion function of some lossy source coding problems involving infinite-valued distortion functions

For a number of lossy source coding problems it is shown that even if the usual single-letter sum-rate-distortion expressions may become invalid for non-infinite distortion functions, they can be approached, to any desired accuracy, via the usual valid expressions for appropriately truncated finite versions of the distortion functions.
