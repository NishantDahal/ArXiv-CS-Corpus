An Analytical Survey of Provenance Sanitization

Security is likely becoming a critical factor in the future adoption of provenance technology, because of the risk of inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information. In this survey paper we review the state of the art in secure provenance, considering mechanisms for controlling access, and the extent to which these mechanisms preserve provenance integrity. We examine seven systems or approaches, comparing features and identifying areas for future work.
