A novel interactive OBE approach in SCM pedagogy using beer game simulation theory

The primary challenge in SCM pedagogy is the learners interaction with the dynamic nature of supply chain transactions. Once achieved, it is also required to evaluate learners learning experience based on their performance. In this paper, a combination of outcome-based education (OBE) and simulation-based education is proposed focusing on beer game theory. The analysis is based on 336 runs of beer game simulation within a target group of 56 participants divided into 14 subgroups (SG1-SG14).The purpose of the study is mainly to investigate the effect of mutual interactions on students learning process using supply chain total cost and ordering fluctuations as critical measurement criteria.
