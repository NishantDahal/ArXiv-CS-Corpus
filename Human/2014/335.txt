Interference Statistics and Capacity Analysis for Uplink Transmission in Two-Tier Small Cell Networks: A Geometric Probability Approach

Small cell networks are evolving as an economically viable solution to ameliorate the capacity and coverage of state-of-the-art wireless cellular systems. Nonetheless, the dense and unplanned deployment of the small cells (e.g., femtocells, picocells) with restricted user access significantly increases the impact of interference on the overall network performance. To this end, this paper presents a novel framework to derive the statistics of the interference considering dedicated and shared spectrum access for uplink transmissions in two-tier small cell networks such as the macrocell-femtocell networks. The derived expressions are validated by the Monte-Carlo simulations. Numerical results are generated to assess the feasibility of shared and dedicated spectrum access in femtocells under varying traffic load and spectral reuse scenarios.
