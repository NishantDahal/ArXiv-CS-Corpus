An ontology-based approach to the optimization of non-binary (2,v)-regular LDPC codes

A non-binary (2,v)-regular LDPC code is defined by a parity-check matrix with column weight 2 and row weight v. In this report, we give an ontology-based approach to the optimization for this class of codes. All possible inter-connected cycle patterns that lead to low symbol-weight codewords are identified to put together the ontology. The optimization goal is to improve the distance property of equivalent binary images. Using the proposed method, the estimation and optimization of bit-distance spectrum becomes easily handleable. Three codes in the CCSDS recommendation are analyzed and several codes with good minimum bit-distance are designed.
