Correlated Source Coded Sequences with Compromised Channel and Source Symbols using Shannon's Cipher System

Correlated sources are present in communication systems where protocols ensure that there is some predetermined information for sources to transmit. Here, two correlated sources across a channel with eavesdroppers are investigated, and conditions for perfect secrecy when some channel information and some source data symbols (the predetermined information) have been wiretapped are determined. The adversary in this situation has access to more information than if a link is wiretapped only and can thus determine more about a particular source. This scenario caters for an application where the eavesdropper has access to some preexisting information. We provide bounds for the channel and key rates for this scenario. Further, we provide a method to reduce the key lengths required for perfect secrecy.
