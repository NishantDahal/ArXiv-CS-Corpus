Greatest solutions of equations in $\text{CLL}_R$ and its application

This paper explores the process calculus $\text{CLL}_R$ furtherly.
  First, we prove that for any equation $X=_{RS} t_X$ such that $X$ is strongly guarded in $t_X$, $\langle X|X=t_X \rangle$ is the largest solution w.r.t $\sqsubseteq_{RS}$.
  Second, we encode a fragment of action-based CTL in $\text{CLL}_R$.
