A Weighted Common Subgraph Matching Algorithm

We propose a weighted common subgraph (WCS) matching algorithm to find the most similar subgraphs in two labeled weighted graphs. WCS matching, as a natural generalization of the equal-sized graph matching or subgraph matching, finds wide applications in many computer vision and machine learning tasks. In this paper, the WCS matching is first formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem over the set of partial permutation matrices. Then it is approximately solved by a recently proposed combinatorial optimization framework - Graduated NonConvexity and Concavity Procedure (GNCCP). Experimental comparisons on both synthetic graphs and real world images validate its robustness against noise level, problem size, outlier number, and edge density.
