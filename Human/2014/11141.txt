Quantum entropy-typical subspace and universal data compression

The quantum entropy-typical subspace theory is specified. It is shown that any mixed state with von Neumann entropy less than h can be preserved approximately by the entropy-typical subspace with entropy= h. This result implies an universal compression scheme for the case that the von Neumann entropy of the source does not exceed h.
