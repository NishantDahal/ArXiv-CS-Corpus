Computing a Solution of Feigenbaum's Functional Equation in Polynomial Time

Lanford has shown that Feigenbaum's functional equation has an analytic solution. We show that this solution is a polynomial time computable function. This implies in particular that the so-called first Feigenbaum constant is a polynomial time computable real number.
