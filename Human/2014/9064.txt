In principle determination of generic priors

Probability theory as extended logic is completed such that essentially any probability may be determined. This is done by considering propositional logic (as opposed to predicate logic) as syntactically suffcient and imposing a symmetry from propositional logic. It is shown how the notions of `possibility' and `property' may be suffciently represented in propositional logic such that 1) the principle of indifference drops out and becomes essentially combinatoric in nature and 2) one may appropriately represent assumptions where one assumes there is a space of possibilities but does not assume the size of the space.
