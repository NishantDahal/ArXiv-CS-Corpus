The asymmetric DoF Region for the 3-user MxN Interference Channel

In this paper, the 3-user Gaussian MIMO interference channel is considered. The asymmetric distribution of the DoF, where different users have different number of DoF, is studied. Two cases are presented, the first is when all transmitters and receivers have equal number of antennas $M$, the other when the transmitters have $M$ antennas each, while the receivers have $N$ antennas each. It is assumed that the channel coefficients are constant and known to all transmitters and receivers. The region of the achievable DoF tuple $(d_1; d_2; d_3)$ is presented.
