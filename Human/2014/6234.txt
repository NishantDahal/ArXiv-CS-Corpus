Diversity versus Multiplexing at Finite Blocklength

A finite blocklenth analysis of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is presented, based on nonasymptotic bounds on the maximum channel coding rate of multiple-antenna block-memoryless Rayleigh-fading channels.The bounds in this paper allow one to numerically assess for which packet size, number of antennas, and degree of channel selectivity, diversity-exploiting schemes are close to optimal, and when instead the available spatial degrees of freedom should be used to provide spatial multiplexing. This finite blocklength view on the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff provides insights on the design of delay-sensitive ultra-reliable communication links.
