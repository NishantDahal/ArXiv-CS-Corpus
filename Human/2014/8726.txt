Staged Evolution with Quality Gates for Model Libraries

Model evolution is widely considered as a subject under research. Despite its role in research, common purpose concepts, approaches, solutions, and methodologies are missing. Limiting the scope to model libraries makes model evolution and related quality concerns manageable, as we show below. In this paper, we put forward our quality staged model evolution theory for model libraries. It is founded on evolution graphs, which offer a structure for model evolution in model libraries through evolution steps. These evolution steps eventually form a sequence, which can be partitioned into stages by quality gates. Each quality gate is defined by a lightweight quality model and respective characteristics fostering reusability.
