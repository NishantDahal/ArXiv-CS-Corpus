ViDaExpert: user-friendly tool for nonlinear visualization and analysis of multidimensional vectorial data

ViDaExpert is a tool for visualization and analysis of multidimensional vectorial data. ViDaExpert is able to work with data tables of "object-feature" type that might contain numerical feature values as well as textual labels for rows (objects) and columns (features). ViDaExpert implements several statistical methods such as standard and weighted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the method of elastic maps (non-linear version of PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), multilinear regression, K-Means clustering, a variant of decision tree construction algorithm. Equipped with several user-friendly dialogs for configuring data point representations (size, shape, color) and fast 3D viewer, ViDaExpert is a handy tool allowing to construct an interactive 3D-scene representing a table of data in multidimensional space and perform its quick and insightfull statistical analysis, from basic to advanced methods.
