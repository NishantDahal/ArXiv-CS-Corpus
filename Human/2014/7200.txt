An algebraic study of linkages with helical joints

Methods from algebra and algebraic geometry have been used in various ways to study linkages in kinematics. These methods have failed so far for the study of linkages with helical joints (joints with screw motion), because of the presence of some non-algebraic relations. In this article, we explore a delicate reduction of some analytic equations in kinematics to algebraic questions via a theorem of Ax. As an application, we give a classification of mobile closed 5-linkages with revolute, prismatic, and helical joints.
