Keeping a Crowd Safe: On the Complexity of Parameterized Verification (Corrected version)

We survey some results on the automatic verification of parameterized programs without identities. These are systems composed of arbitrarily many components, all of them running exactly the same finite-state program. We discuss the complexity of deciding that no component reaches an unsafe state. The note is addressed at theoretical computer scientists in general.
