A Case Study on Model-Based Development of Robotic Systems using MontiArc with Embedded Automata

Software development for service robotics is inherently complex. Even a single robot requires the composition of several sensors, actuators, and software modules. The systems are usually developed by groups of domain experts, rarely software engineering experts. Thus the resulting software systems are monolithic programs solving a single problem on a single platform. We claim modeling of both structure and behavior of robots in a modular way leads to better reusable software. We report on a study about the modeling of robotics software with the structure and behavior modeling language MontiArcAutomaton. This study assesses the benefits and difficulties of model-based robotics software development using MontiArc-Automaton. Our findings are based on a survey, discussions with the participants, and key figures from their development behavior. We present the project, our study, lessons learned, and future work based on the insights gained
