Numerical Investigation of Effects of Compound Angle and Length to Diameter Ratio on Adiabatic Film Cooling Effectiveness

A modification has been done in the normal injection hole of 35 degree, by injecting the cold fluid at different angles(compound angle) in lateral direction, providing a significant change in the shape of holes which later we found in our numerical investigation giving good quality of effectiveness in cooling. Different L/D ratios are also studied for each compound angle. The numerical simulation is performed based on Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes(RANS) equations with k-epsilon turbulence model by using Fluent(Commercial Software). Adiabatic Film Cooling Effectiveness has been studied for compound angles of (0, 30, 45 and 60 degrees) and L/D ratios of (1, 2, 3 and 4) on a hole of 6mm diameter with blowing ratio 0.5. The findings are obtained from the results, concludes that the trend of laterally averaged adiabatic effectiveness is the function of L/D ratio and compound angle.
