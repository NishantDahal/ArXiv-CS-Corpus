Towards designing artificial universes for artificial agents under interaction closure

We are interested in designing artificial universes for artifi- cial agents. We view artificial agents as networks of high- level processes on top of of a low-level detailed-description system. We require that the high-level processes have some intrinsic explanatory power and we introduce an extension of informational closure namely interaction closure to capture this. Then we derive a method to design artificial universes in the form of finite Markov chains which exhibit high-level pro- cesses that satisfy the property of interaction closure. We also investigate control or information transfer which we see as an building block for networks representing artificial agents.
