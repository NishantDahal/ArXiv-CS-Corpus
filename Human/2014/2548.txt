Performance Improvement of PAPR Reduction for OFDM Signal In LTE System

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is an emerging research field of wireless communication. It is one of the most proficient multi-carrier transmission techniques widely used today as broadband wired & wireless applications having several attributes such as provides greater immunity to multipath fading & impulse noise, eliminating inter symbol interference (ISI), inter carrier interference (ICI) & the need for equalizers. OFDM signals have a general problem of high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) which is defined as the ratio of the peak power to the average power of the OFDM signal. The drawback of high PAPR is that the dynamic range of the power amplifier (PA) and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). In this paper, an improved scheme of amplitude clipping & filtering method is proposed and implemented which shows the significant improvement in case of PAPR reduction while increasing slight BER compare to an existing method. Also, the comparative studies of different parameters will be covered.
