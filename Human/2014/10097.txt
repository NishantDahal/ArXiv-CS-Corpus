The worm algorithm for the Ising model is rapidly mixing

We prove rapid mixing of the Prokofiev-Svistunov (or worm) algorithm for the zero-field ferromagnetic Ising model, on all finite graphs and at all temperatures. As a corollary, we show how to rigorously construct simple and efficient approximation schemes for the Ising susceptibility and two-point correlation function.
