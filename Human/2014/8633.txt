The Binary Energy Harvesting Channel with a Unit-Sized Battery

We consider a binary energy harvesting communication channel with a finite-sized battery at the transmitter. In this model, the channel input is constrained by the available energy at each channel use, which is driven by an external energy harvesting process, the size of the battery, and the previous channel inputs. We consider an abstraction where energy is harvested in binary units and stored in a battery with the capacity of a single unit, and the channel inputs are binary. Viewing the available energy in the battery as a state, this is a state-dependent channel with input-dependent states, memory in the states, and causal state information available at the transmitter only. We find an equivalent representation for this channel based on the timings of the symbols, and determine the capacity of the resulting equivalent timing channel via an auxiliary random variable. We give achievable rates based on certain selections of this auxiliary random variable which resemble lattice coding for the timing channel. We develop upper bounds for the capacity by using a genie-aided method, and also by quantifying the leakage of the state information to the receiver. We show that the proposed achievable rates are asymptotically capacity achieving for small energy harvesting rates. We extend the results to the case of ternary channel inputs. Our achievable rates give the capacity of the binary channel within 0.03 bits/channel use, the ternary channel within 0.05 bits/channel use, and outperform basic Shannon strategies that only consider instantaneous battery states, for all parameter values.
