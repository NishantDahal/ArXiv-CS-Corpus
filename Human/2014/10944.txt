Adaptive Molecule Transmission Rate for Diffusion Based Molecular Communication

In this paper, a simple memory limited transmitter for molecular communication is proposed, in which information is encoded in the diffusion rate of the molecules. Taking advantage of memory, the proposed transmitter reduces the ISI problem by properly adjusting its diffusion rate. The error probability of the proposed scheme is derived and the result is compared with the lower bound on error probability of the optimum transmitter. It is shown that the performance of introduced transmitter is near optimal (under certain simplifications). Simplicity is the key feature of the presented communication system: the transmitter follows a simple rule, the receiver is a simple threshold decoder and only one type of molecule is used to convey the information.
