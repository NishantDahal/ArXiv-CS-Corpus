Linear Intransitive Temporal Logic of Knowledge LTK_r, Decision Algorithms, Inference Rules

Our paper investigates the linear logic of knowledge and time LTK_r with reflexive intransitive time relation. The logic is defined semantically, -- as the set of formulas which are true at special frames with intransitive and reflexive time binary relation. The LTK_r -frames are linear chains of clusters connected by a reflexive intransitive relation $R_T$. Elements inside a cluster are connected by several equivalence relations imitating the knowledge of different agents. We study the decidability problem for formulas and inference rules. Decidability for formulas follows from decidability w.r.t. admissible inference rules.To study admissibility, we introduce some special constructive Kripke models useful for description of admissibility of inference rules. With a special technique of definable valuations we find an algorithm determining admissible inference rules in LTK_r. That is, we show that the logic LTK_r is decidable and decidable with respect to admissibility of inference rules.
