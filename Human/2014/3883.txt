A Note on NP-Hardness of Preemptive Mean Flow-Time Scheduling for Parallel Machines

In the paper "The complexity of mean flow time scheduling problems with release times", by Baptiste, Brucker, Chrobak, DÃ¼rr, Kravchenko and Sourd, the authors claimed to prove strong NP-hardness of the scheduling problem $P|pmtn,r_j|\sum C_j$, namely multiprocessor preemptive scheduling where the objective is to minimize the mean flow time. We point out a serious error in their proof and give a new proof of strong NP-hardness for this problem.
