Arrival Modeling and Error Analysis for Molecular Communication via Diffusion with Drift

The arrival of molecules in molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) is a counting process, exhibiting by its nature binomial distribution. Even if the binomial process describes well the arrival of molecules, when considering consecutively sent symbols, the process struggles to work with the binomial cumulative distribution function (CDF). Therefore, in the literature, Poisson and Gaussian approximations of the binomial distribution are used. In this paper, we analyze these two approximations of the binomial model of the arrival process in MCvD with drift. Considering the distance, drift velocity, and the number of emitted molecules, we investigate the regions in which either Poisson or Gaussian model is better in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) of the CDFs; we confirm the boundaries of the region via numerical simulations. Moreover, we derive the error probabilities for continuous communication and analyze which model approximates it more accurately.
