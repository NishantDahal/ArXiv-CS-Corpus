Adaptive Power Management for Wireless Base Station in Smart Grid Environment

The growing concerns of a global environmental change raises a revolution on the way of utilizing energy. In wireless industry, green wireless communications has recently gained increasing attention and is expected to play a major role in reduction of electrical power consumption. In particular, actions to promote energy saving of wireless communications with regard to environmental protection are becoming imperative. To this purpose, we study a green communication system model where wireless base station is provisioned with a combination of renewable power source and electrical grid to minimize power consumption as well as meeting the users' demand. More specifically, we focus on an adaptive power management for wireless base station to minimize power consumption under various uncertainties including renewable power generation, power price, and wireless traffic load. We believe that demand side power management solution based on the studied communication architecture is a major step towards green wireless communications.
