A Study On ID-based Authentication Schemes for Telecare Medical Information System

The smart card based authentication schemes are designed and developed to ensure secure and authorized communication between remote user and the server. In recent times, many smart card based authentication schemes for the telecare medical information systems (TMIS) have been presented. In this article, we briefly discuss some of the recently published smart card based authentication schemes for TMIS and try to show why efficient login and password change phases are required. In other word, the study demonstrates how inefficient password change phase leads to denial of server attack and how inefficient login phase increase the communication and computation overhead and decrease the performance of the system.
