Simulations on Consumer Tests: A Perspective for Driver Assistance Systems

This article discusses new challenges for series development regarding the vehicle safety that arise from the recently published AEB test protocol by the consumer-test-organisation EuroNCAP for driver assistance systems [6]. The tests from the test protocol are of great significance for an OEM that sells millions of cars each year, due to the fact that a positive rating of the vehicle-under-test (VUT) in safety relevant aspects is important for the reputation of a car manufacturer. The further intensification and aggravation of the test requirements for those systems is one of the challenges, that has to be mastered in order to continuously make significant contributions to safety for high-volume cars. Therefore, it is to be shown how a simulation approach may support the development process, especially with tolerance analysis. This article discusses the current stage of work, steps that are planned for the future and results that can be expected at the end of such an analysis.
