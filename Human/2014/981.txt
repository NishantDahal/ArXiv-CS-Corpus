Mobile Offloading in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks

This paper describes a strategy that was designed, implemented, and presented at the {\it Mobile Ad Hoc Networking Interoperability and Cooperation (MANIAC) Challenge 2013}. The theme of the MANIAC Challenge 2013 was ``Mobile Data Offloading,'' and consisted on developing and comparatively evaluating strategies to offload infrastructure access points via customer ad hoc forwarding using handheld devices (e.g., tablets and smartphones). According to the challenge rules, a hop-by-hop bidding contest (or ``auction'') should decide the path of each data packet towards its destination. Consequently, each team should rely on other teams' willingness to forward packets for them in order to get their traffic across the network. In this application scenario, the incentive for customers to join the ad hoc network is discounted monthly fees, while operators should benefit from decreased infrastructure costs. Following the rules of MANIAC Challenge 2013, this paper proposes a strategy that is based on the concept of how ``tight'' a node is to successfully deliver a packet to its destination within a given deadline. This ``tightness'' idea relies on a shortest-path analysis of the underlying network graph, and it is used to define three sub-strategies that specify a) how to participate in an auction; b) how to announce an auction; and c) how to decide who wins the announced auction. The proposed strategy seeks to minimize network resource utilization and to promote cooperative behavior among participant nodes.
