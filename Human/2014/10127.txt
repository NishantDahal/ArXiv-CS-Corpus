Joint Radar-Communications Performance Inner Bounds: Data versus Estimation Information Rates

We investigate cooperative radar and communications signaling. Each system typically considers the other system a source of interference. Consequently, the traditional solution is to isolate the two systems spectrally or spatially. By considering the radar and communications operations to be a single joint system, we derive inner or achievable performance bounds on a receiver that observes communications and radar return in the same frequency allocation. Bounds on performance of the joint system are measured in terms of data information rate for communications and a novel radar estimation information rate parameterization for the radar.
