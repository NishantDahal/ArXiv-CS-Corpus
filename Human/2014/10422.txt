Feasibility of In-band Full-Duplex Radio Transceivers with Imperfect RF Components: Analysis and Enhanced Cancellation Algorithms

In this paper we provide an overview regarding the feasibility of in-band full-duplex transceivers under imperfect RF components. We utilize results and findings from the recent research on full-duplex communications, while introducing also transmitter-induced thermal noise into the analysis. This means that the model of the RF impairments used in this paper is the most comprehensive thus far. By assuming realistic parameter values for the different transceiver components, it is shown that IQ imaging and transmitter-induced nonlinearities are the most significant sources of distortion in in-band full-duplex transceivers, in addition to linear self-interference. Motivated by this, we propose a novel augmented nonlinear digital self-interference canceller that is able to model and hence suppress all the essential transmitter imperfections jointly. This is also verified and demonstrated by extensive waveform simulations.
