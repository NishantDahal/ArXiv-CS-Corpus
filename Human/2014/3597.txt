Integrated Maintenance: analysis and perspective of innovation in railway sector

The high costs for the management of the modern and complex industrial control systems make it necessary to enhance the current maintenance processes. Therefore, the need arises to clearly define the goals of the maintenance, in order to evolve and continuously enhance the management methods, to efficiently integrate the maintenance activities with the ones related to the production, the service provisioning, and the operation, and to use smart computer-based maintenance systems. This paper proposes a general maintenance approach and its specific application to the railway sector.
