Controlling Citizens Cyber Viewing Using Enhanced Internet Content Filters

Information passing through internet is generally unrestricted and uncontrollable and a good web content filter acts very much like a sieve. This paper looks at how citizens internet viewing can be controlled using content filters to prevent access to illegal sites and malicious contents in Nigeria. Primary data were obtained by administering 100 questionnaires. The data was analyzed by a software package called Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The result of the study shows that 66.4% of the respondents agreed that the internet is been abused and the abuse can be controlled by the use of content filters. The PHP, MySQL and Apache were used to design a content filter program. It was recommended that a lot still need to be done by public organizations, academic institutions, government and its agencies especially the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) in Nigeria to control the internet abuse by the under aged and criminals.
