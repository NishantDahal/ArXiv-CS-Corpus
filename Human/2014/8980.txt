Distributed Power Splitting for SWIPT in Relay Interference Channels using Game Theory

In this paper, we consider simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in relay interference channels, where multiple source-destination pairs communicate through their dedicated energy harvesting relays. Each relay needs to split its received signal from sources into two streams: one for information forwarding and the other for energy harvesting. We develop a distributed power splitting framework using game theory to derive a profile of power splitting ratios for all relays that can achieve a good network-wide performance. Specifically, non-cooperative games are respectively formulated for pure amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) networks, in which each link is modeled as a strategic player who aims to maximize its own achievable rate. The existence and uniqueness for the Nash equilibriums (NEs) of the formulated games are analyzed and a distributed algorithm with provable convergence to achieve the NEs is also developed. Subsequently, the developed framework is extended to the more general network setting with mixed AF and DF relays. All the theoretical analyses are validated by extensive numerical results. Simulation results show that the proposed game-theoretical approach can achieve a near-optimal network-wide performance on average, especially for the scenarios with relatively low and moderate interference.
