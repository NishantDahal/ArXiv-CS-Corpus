Design of an Amplifier through Second Generation Current Conveyor

This paper describes the architecture of first and second generation current conveyor (CCI and CCII respectively) and designing an amplifier using second generation current conveyor. The designed amplifier through CCII+ can be used in various analog computation circuits and is superior in performance than the classical opamp. It provides better gain with higher accuracy.
