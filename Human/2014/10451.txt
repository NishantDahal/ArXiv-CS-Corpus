Provide High-QoS of the High-Speed Railway Mobile Communications in Cyber-Physical Systems

Technical advances in networks, embedded computing, and wireless communications are leading to the next generation of complex intelligent systems called Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). CPS promises to transform the way we interact with the physical world. Efficient and reliable operation of the CTCS-3 (Chinese Train Control System Level 3) is great protection of the national economy and public safety. The CTCS-3 is based on GSM-R (GSM for Railway) to achieve a continuous and two-way transmission of information between ground and the train. To ensure the growing needs of safety, fastness and service diversity of China's railway, the pursuit of high-QoS has been the key of the relative study. This paper examines the main characteristics of GSM-R and the requirements of all-layers' QoS indicators for GSM-R. Several main technologies of improving QoS indicators of all-layers are summarized. As a solution, a comprehensive scheme is proposed to improve the delay and packet loss indicators. An example is also presented that illustrates the real-time features of the proposed solution. Based on the CPS characteristics are highly correlated with the QoS indicators, conclusions are made that GSM-R can provide a reliable and real-time way for message.
