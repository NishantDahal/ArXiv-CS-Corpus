On the Privacy of Optimization Approaches

Ensuring privacy of sensitive data is essential in many contexts, such as healthcare data, banks, e-commerce, wireless sensor networks, and social networks. It is common that different entities coordinate or want to rely on a third party to solve a specific problem. At the same time, no entity wants to publish its problem data during the solution procedure unless there is a privacy guarantee. Unlike cryptography and differential privacy based approaches, the methods based on optimization lack a quantification of the privacy they can provide. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a mechanism to quantify the privacy of a broad class of optimization approaches. In particular, we formally define a one-to-many relation, which relates a given adversarial observed message to an uncertainty set of the problem data. This relation quantifies the potential ambiguity on problem data due to the employed optimization approaches. The privacy definitions are then formalized based on the uncertainty sets. The properties of the proposed privacy measure is analyzed. The key ideas are illustrated with examples, including localization, average consensus, among others.
