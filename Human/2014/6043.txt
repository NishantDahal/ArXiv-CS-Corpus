Influence of Culture on e-Government Acceptance in Saudi Arabia

The main purpose of this research is to determine the influence of culture on e-government (electronic government) acceptance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Citizens' transactional interactions (electronic transactions or e-transactions) with the government via the Internet are examined. Multiple models and theories in extant literature were referred to in identifying the research context requirements that enabled the analysis of e-transaction acceptance. A new research model that fits the research context was developed to predict and explain how acceptance is affected. A sample of 671 Saudi citizens was recruited using an online survey. Structural equation modelling was used to assess the impact on intention to use e-transactions. Preference for using e-transactions as a communication method, perceptions of the compatibility of e-transactions with values and citizens' needs, communicability of the results of using e-transactions, trust in the Internet as a medium of communication with the government, and conservation values are positive significant determinants of e-transaction acceptance. Conversely, the influence of trust in government agencies and motivation towards gaining prestige and possessing dominance over people and resources was negative. The findings of this study include design and implementation strategies that can serve as guidance for the Saudi government, as well as for the developers and implementers of e-transactions in the KSA.
