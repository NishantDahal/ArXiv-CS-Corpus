Robust topology optimisation of microstructural details without length scale separation - using a spectral coarse basis preconditioner

This paper applies topology optimisation to the design of structures with periodic microstructural details without length scale separation, i.e. considering the complete macroscopic structure and its response, while resolving all microstructural details, as compared to the often used homogenisation approach. The approach takes boundary conditions into account and ensures connected and macroscopically optimised microstructures regardless of the difference in micro- and macroscopic length scales. This results in microstructures tailored for specific applications rather than specific properties.
  Dealing with the complete macroscopic structure and its response is computationally challenging as very fine discretisations are needed in order to resolve all microstructural details. Therefore, this article shows the benefits of applying a contrast-independent spectral preconditioner based on the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) to large structures with fully-resolved microstructural details.
  The density-based topology optimisation approach combined with a Heaviside projection filter and a stochastic robust formulation is used on various problems, with both periodic and layered microstructures. The presented approach is shown to allow for the topology optimisation of very large problems in \textsc{Matlab}, specifically a problem with 26 million displacement degrees of freedom in 26 hours using a single computational thread.
