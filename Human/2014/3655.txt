Super-resolution Line Spectrum Estimation with Block Priors

We address the problem of super-resolution line spectrum estimation of an undersampled signal with block prior information. The component frequencies of the signal are assumed to take arbitrary continuous values in known frequency blocks. We formulate a general semidefinite program to recover these continuous-valued frequencies using theories of positive trigonometric polynomials. The proposed semidefinite program achieves super-resolution frequency recovery by taking advantage of known structures of frequency blocks. Numerical experiments show great performance enhancements using our method.
