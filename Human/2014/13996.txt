HotBox: Testing Temperature Effects in Sensor Networks

Low-power wireless networks, especially in outside deployments, are exposed to a wide range of temperatures. The detrimental effect of high temperatures on communication quality is well known. To investigate these influences under controlled conditions, we present HotBox, a solution with the following properties: (1) It allows exposition of sensor motes to a wide range of temperatures with a high degree of accuracy. (2) It supports specifying exact spatial orientation of motes which, if not ensured, interferes with repeatable experiment setups. (3) It is reasonably easy to assemble by following the information (code, PCB schematics, hardware list and crafting instructions) available online, facilitating further use of the platforms by other researchers. After presenting HotBox, we will show its performance and prove its feasibility as evaluation platform by conducting several experiments. These experiments additionally provide further insight into the influence of temperature effects on communication performance in low-power wireless networks.
