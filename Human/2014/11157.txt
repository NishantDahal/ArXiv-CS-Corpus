Blind Adaptive MIMO Receivers for CDMA Systems with Space-Time Block-Codes and Low-Cost Algorithms

In this paper we present low-complexity blind multi-input multi-output (MIMO) adaptive linear multiuser receivers for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems using multiple transmit antennas and space-time block codes (STBC) in multipath channels. A space-time code-constrained constant modulus (CCM) design criterion based on constrained optimization techniques and low-complexity stochastic gradient (SG) adaptive algorithms are developed for estimating the parameters of the space-time linear receivers. The receivers are designed by exploiting the unique structure imposed by both spreading codes and STBC. A blind space-time channel estimation scheme for STBC systems based on a subspace approach is also proposed along with an efficient SG algorithm. Simulation results for a downlink scenario assess the receiver structures and algorithms and show that the proposed schemes achieve excellent performance, outperforming existing methods.
