Learning Sparsely Used Overcomplete Dictionaries via Alternating Minimization

We consider the problem of sparse coding, where each sample consists of a sparse linear combination of a set of dictionary atoms, and the task is to learn both the dictionary elements and the mixing coefficients. Alternating minimization is a popular heuristic for sparse coding, where the dictionary and the coefficients are estimated in alternate steps, keeping the other fixed. Typically, the coefficients are estimated via $\ell_1$ minimization, keeping the dictionary fixed, and the dictionary is estimated through least squares, keeping the coefficients fixed. In this paper, we establish local linear convergence for this variant of alternating minimization and establish that the basin of attraction for the global optimum (corresponding to the true dictionary and the coefficients) is $\order{1/s^2}$, where $s$ is the sparsity level in each sample and the dictionary satisfies RIP. Combined with the recent results of approximate dictionary estimation, this yields provable guarantees for exact recovery of both the dictionary elements and the coefficients, when the dictionary elements are incoherent.
