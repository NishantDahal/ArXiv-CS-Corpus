Local Doubling Dimension of Point Sets

We introduce the notion of t-restricted doubling dimension of a point set in Euclidean space as the local intrinsic dimension up to scale t. In many applications information is only relevant for a fixed range of scales. We present an algorithm to construct a hierarchical net-tree up to scale t which we denote as the net-forest. We present a method based on Locality Sensitive Hashing to compute all near neighbours of points within a certain distance. Our construction of the net-forest is probabilistic, and we guarantee that with high probability, the net-forest is supplemented with the correct neighbouring information. We apply our net-forest construction scheme to create an approximate Cech complex up to a fixed scale; and its complexity depends on the local intrinsic dimension up to that scale.
