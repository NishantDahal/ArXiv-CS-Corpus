CBM: A Crypto-Coded Modulation Scheme for Rate Information Concealing and Robustness Boosting

Exposing the rate information of wireless transmission enables highly efficient attacks that can severely degrade the performance of a network at very low cost. In this paper, we introduce an integrated solution to conceal the rate information of wireless transmissions while simultaneously boosting the resiliency against interference. The proposed solution is based on a generalization of Trellis Coded Modulation combined with Cryptographic Interleaving. We develop algorithms for discovering explicit codes for concealing any modulation in {BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM}. We demonstrate that in most cases this modulation hiding scheme has the side effect of boosting resiliency by up to 8.5dB.
