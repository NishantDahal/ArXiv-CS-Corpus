Does Restraining End Effect Matter in EMD-Based Modeling Framework for Time Series Prediction? Some Experimental Evidences

Following the "decomposition-and-ensemble" principle, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based modeling framework has been widely used as a promising alternative for nonlinear and nonstationary time series modeling and prediction. The end effect, which occurs during the sifting process of EMD and is apt to distort the decomposed sub-series and hurt the modeling process followed, however, has been ignored in previous studies. Addressing the end effect issue, this study proposes to incorporate end condition methods into EMD-based decomposition and ensemble modeling framework for one- and multi-step ahead time series prediction. Four well-established end condition methods, Mirror method, Coughlin's method, Slope-based method, and Rato's method, are selected, and support vector regression (SVR) is employed as the modeling technique. For the purpose of justification and comparison, well-known NN3 competition data sets are used and four well-established prediction models are selected as benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrated that significant improvement can be achieved by the proposed EMD-based SVR models with end condition methods. The EMD-SBM-SVR model and EMD-Rato-SVR model, in particular, achieved the best prediction performances in terms of goodness of forecast measures and equality of accuracy of competing forecasts test.
