Optimal Offline and Competitive Online Strategies for Transmitter-Receiver Energy Harvesting

Transmitter-receiver energy harvesting model is assumed, where both the transmitter and receiver are powered by random energy source. Given a fixed number of bits, the problem is to find the optimal transmission power profile at the transmitter and ON-OFF profile at the receiver to minimize the transmission time. Structure of the optimal offline strategy is derived together with an optimal offline policy. An online policy with competitive ratio of strictly less than two is also derived.
