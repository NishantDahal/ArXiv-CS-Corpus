Hidden Markov Model for Inferring Learner Task Using Mouse Movement

One of the issues of e-learning web based application is to understand how the learner interacts with an e-learning application to perform a given task. This study proposes a methodology to analyze learner mouse movement in order to infer the task performed. To do this, a Hidden Markov Model is used for modeling the interaction of the learner with an e-learning application. The obtained results show the ability of our model to analyze the interaction in order to recognize the task performed by the learner.
