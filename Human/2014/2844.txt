Multiagent Conflict Resolution for a Specification Network of Discrete-Event Coordinating Agents

This paper presents a novel compositional approach to distributed coordination module (CM) synthesis for multiple discrete-event agents in the formal languages and automata framework. The approach is supported by two original ideas. The first is a new formalism called the Distributed Constraint Specification Network (DCSN) that can comprehensibly describe the networking constraint relationships among distributed agents. The second is multiagent conflict resolution planning, which entails generating and using AND/OR graphs to compactly represent conflict resolution (synthesis-process) plans for a DCSN. Together with the framework of local CM design developed in the authors' earlier work, the systematic approach supports separately designing local and deconflicting CM's for individual agents in accordance to a selected conflict resolution plan. Composing the agent models and the CM's designed furnishes an overall nonblocking coordination solution that meets the set of inter-agent constraints specified in a given DCSN.
