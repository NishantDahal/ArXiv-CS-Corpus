Energy efficient neighbor selection for flat wireless sensor networks

In this paper we have analyzed energy efficient neighbour selection algorithms for routing in wireless sensor networks. Since energy saving or consumption is an important aspect of wireless sensor networks, its precise usage is highly desirable both for the faithful performance of network and to increase the network life time. For this work, we have considered a flat network topology where every node has the same responsibility and capability. We have compared two energy efficient algorithms and analyzed their performances with increase in number of nodes, time rounds and node failures.
