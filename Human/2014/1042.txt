Exploring Steinitz-Rademacher polyhedra: A challenge for automated reasoning tools

This note reports on some experiments, using a handful of standard automated reasoning tools, for exploring Steinitz-Rademacher polyhedra, which are models of a certain first-order theory of incidence structures. This theory and its models, even simple ones, presents significant, geometrically fascinating challenges for automated reasoning tools.
