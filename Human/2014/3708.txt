Inventions on dialog boxes used in GUI

The dialog boxes are useful in case of displaying warnings, errors, confirmations etc. in special situations. A typical dialog box is displayed in a small window with some text message along with a few options for the user to select. However, there are certain difficulties associated in programming and implementing a conventional dialog box, such as, severe programming effort, rigidity of the hard coded message, obscuring screen space and so on. There is a need to overcome these difficulties of the dialog box to make them more efficient and useful.
  The modality of the dialog boxes also creates some limitations. While modal dialog boxes needs to be closed explicitly by the user, modeless dialog boxes can grow in number and become difficult to control. Thus, an ideal dialog box should be deprived of all the above-mentioned drawbacks. The dialog box should not obscure the screen. The user should be able open multiple dialog boxes but without obscuring the screen.
  This article analyses 5 interesting inventions on dialog boxes selected from US Patent database. Each invention tries to overcome some limitations of a conventional dialog box and provides some innovative features. Each solution is also analyzed from a TRIZ perspective.
