A framework for reuse of multi-view UML artifacts

Software is typically modeled from different viewpoints such as structural view, behavioral view and functional view. Few existing works can be considered as applying multi-view retrieval approaches. A number of important issues regarding mapping of entities during multi-view retrieval of UML models is identified in this study. In response, we describe a framework for reusing UML artifacts, and discuss how our retrieval approach tackles the identified issues.
