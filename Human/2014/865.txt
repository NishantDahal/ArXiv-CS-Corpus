An intuitionistic version of Ramsey Theorem (italian version)

Ramsey Theorem [6] for pairs is intuitionistically but not classically provable: it is equivalent to a subclassical principle [2]. In this note we show that Ramsey may be restated in an intuitionistically provable form, which is informative (or at least without negations), and classically equivalent to the original. With respect to previous works of the same kind, we do not use no counterexample as in [1], [5], nor we add a new principle to the intuitionism as in [4]. We claim that this intuitionistic version of Ramsey could be use to replace Ramsey Theorem in the convergence proof of programs included in [3].
