Accurate merging of images for predictive analysis using combined image

Several Scientific and engineering applications require merging of sampled images for complex perception development. In most cases, for such requirements, images are merged at intensity level. Even though it gives fairly good perception of combined scenario of objects and scenes, it is found that they are not sufficient enough to analyze certain engineering cases. The main problem is incoherent modulation of intensity arising out of phase properties being lost. In order to compensate these losses, combined phase and amplitude merge is demanded. We present here a method which could be used in precision engineering and biological applications where more precise prediction is required of a combined phenomenon. When pixels are added, its original property is lost but accurate merging of intended pixels can be achieved in high quality using frequency domain properties of an image. This paper introduces a technique to merge various images which can be used as a simple but effective technique for overlapped view of a set of images and producing reduced dataset for review purposes.
