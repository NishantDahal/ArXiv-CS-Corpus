On the Behavioral Interpretation of System-Environment Fit and Auto-Resilience

Already 71 years ago Rosenblueth, Wiener, and Bigelow introduced the concept of the "behavioristic study of natural events" and proposed a classification of systems according to the quality of the behaviors they are able to exercise. In this paper we consider the problem of the resilience of a system when deployed in a changing environment, which we tackle by considering the behaviors both the system organs and the environment mutually exercise. We then introduce a partial order and a metric space for those behaviors, and we use them to define a behavioral interpretation of the concept of system-environment fit. Moreover we suggest that behaviors based on the extrapolation of future environmental requirements would allow systems to proactively improve their own system-environment fit and optimally evolve their resilience. Finally we describe how we plan to express a complex optimization strategy in terms of the concepts introduced in this paper.
