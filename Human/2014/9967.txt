When Money Learns to Fly: Towards Sensing as a Service Applications Using Bitcoin

Sensing-as-a-Service (S2aaS) is an emerging Internet of Things (IOT) business model pattern. To be technically feasible and to effectively allow for broad adoption, S2aaS implementations have to overcome manifold systemic hurdles, specifically regarding payment and sensor identification. In an effort to overcome these hurdles, we propose Bitcoin as protocol for S2aaS networks. To lay the groundwork and start the conversation about disruptive changes that Bitcoin technology could bring to S2aaS concepts and IOT in general, we identify and discuss the core characteristics that could drive those changes. We present a conceptual example and describe the basic process of exchanging data for cash using Bitcoin.
