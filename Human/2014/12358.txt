Parallelize Bubble and Merge Sort Algorithms Using Message Passing Interface (MPI)

Sorting has been a profound area for the algorithmic researchers and many resources are invested to suggest more works for sorting algorithms. For this purpose, many existing sorting algorithms were observed in terms of the efficiency of the algorithmic complexity. In this paper we implemented the bubble and merge sort algorithms using Message Passing Interface (MPI) approach. The proposed work tested on two standard datasets (text file) with different size. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is distributing the elements of the input datasets into many additional temporary sub-arrays according to a number of characters in each word. The sizes of each of these sub-arrays are decided depending on a number of elements with the same number of characters in the input array. We implemented MPI using Intel core i7-3610QM ,(8 CPUs),using two approaches (vectors of string and array 3D) . Finally, we get the data structure effects on the performance of the algorithm for that we choice the second approach.
