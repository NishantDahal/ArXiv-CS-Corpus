Near-optimal-sample estimators for spherical Gaussian mixtures

Statistical and machine-learning algorithms are frequently applied to high-dimensional data. In many of these applications data is scarce, and often much more costly than computation time. We provide the first sample-efficient polynomial-time estimator for high-dimensional spherical Gaussian mixtures.
  For mixtures of any $k$ $d$-dimensional spherical Gaussians, we derive an intuitive spectral-estimator that uses $\mathcal{O}_k\bigl(\frac{d\log^2d}{ε^4}\bigr)$ samples and runs in time $\mathcal{O}_{k,ε}(d^3\log^5 d)$, both significantly lower than previously known. The constant factor $\mathcal{O}_k$ is polynomial for sample complexity and is exponential for the time complexity, again much smaller than what was previously known. We also show that $Ω_k\bigl(\frac{d}{ε^2}\bigr)$ samples are needed for any algorithm. Hence the sample complexity is near-optimal in the number of dimensions.
  We also derive a simple estimator for one-dimensional mixtures that uses $\mathcal{O}\bigl(\frac{k \log \frac{k}ε }{ε^2} \bigr)$ samples and runs in time $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\bigl(\frac{k}ε\bigr)^{3k+1}\right)$. Our other technical contributions include a faster algorithm for choosing a density estimate from a set of distributions, that minimizes the $\ell_1$ distance to an unknown underlying distribution.
