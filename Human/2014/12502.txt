Formal Semantic Annotations for Models Interoperability in a PLM environment

Nowadays, the need for system interoperability in or across enterprises has become more and more ubiquitous. Lots of research works have been carried out in the information exchange, transformation, discovery and reuse. One of the main challenges in these researches is to overcome the semantic heterogeneity between enterprise applications along the lifecycle of a product. As a possible solution to assist the semantic interoperability, semantic annotation has gained more and more attentions and is widely used in different domains. In this paper, based on the investigation of the context and the related works, we identify some existing drawbacks and propose a formal semantic annotation approach to support the semantics enrichment of models in a PLM environment.
