AONT-LT: a Data Protection Scheme for Cloud and Cooperative Storage Systems

We propose a variant of the well-known AONT-RS scheme for dispersed storage systems. The novelty consists in replacing the Reed-Solomon code with rateless Luby transform codes. The resulting system, named AONT-LT, is able to improve the performance by dispersing the data over an arbitrarily large number of storage nodes while ensuring limited complexity. The proposed solution is particularly suitable in the case of cooperative storage systems. It is shown that while the AONT-RS scheme requires the adoption of fragmentation for achieving widespread distribution, thus penalizing the performance, the new AONT-LT scheme can exploit variable length codes which allow to achieve very good performance and scalability.
