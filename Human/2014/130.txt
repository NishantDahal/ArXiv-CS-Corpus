Performance Analysis of Spin Transfer Torque Random Access Memory with cross shaped free layer using Heusler Alloys by using micromagnetic studies

We investigated the performance of spin transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) cell with cross shaped Heusler compound based free layer using micromagnetic simulations. We designed the free layer using Cobalt based Heusler compounds. Here in this paper, simulation results predict that switching time from one state to other state is reduced. Also it is examined that critical switching current density to switch the magnetization of free layer of STT RAM cell is reduced.
