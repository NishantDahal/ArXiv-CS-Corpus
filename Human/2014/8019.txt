soCloud: A service-oriented component-based PaaS for managing portability, provisioning, elasticity, and high availability across multiple clouds

Multi-cloud computing is a promising paradigm to support very large scale world wide distributed applications. Multi-cloud computing is the usage of multiple, independent cloud environments, which assumed no priori agreement between cloud providers or third party. However, multi-cloud computing has to face several key challenges such as portability, provisioning, elasticity, and high availability. Developers will not only have to deploy applications to a specific cloud, but will also have to consider application portability from one cloud to another, and to deploy distributed applications spanning multiple clouds. This article presents soCloud a service-oriented component-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) for managing portability, elasticity, provisioning, and high availability across multiple clouds. soCloud is based on the OASIS Service Component Architecture (SCA) standard in order to address portability. soCloud provides services for managing provisioning, elasticity, and high availability across multiple clouds. soCloud has been deployed and evaluated on top of ten existing cloud providers: Windows Azure, DELL KACE, Amazon EC2, CloudBees, OpenShift, dotCloud, Jelastic, Heroku, Appfog, and an Eucalyptus private cloud.
