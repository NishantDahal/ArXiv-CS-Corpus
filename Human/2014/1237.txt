Mc-Dis: A Heterogeneous Neighbor Discovery Protocol for Multi-channel Wireless Networks

In distributed wireless networks, neighbor discovery is one of the bootstrapping primitives in supporting many important network functionalities. Existing neighbor discovery protocols mostly assume a single-channel network model and can only support a subset of duty cycles, thus limiting the energy conservation levels of wireless devices. In this paper, we study the neighbor discovery problem in multi-channel networks where the wireless nodes have heterogeneous duty cycles, asynchronous clocks and asymmetrical channel perceptions, which we formulate as heterogeneous neighbor discovery problem. We first establish a performance bound for any neighbor discovery protocol by relating the two performance metrics, discovery delay and diversity. We then present the design, analysis and evaluation of Mc-Dis, a multi-channel neighbor discovery protocol that can support can practically support almost all duty cycles and guarantee discovery on every channel in multichannel networks even when nodes have asynchronous clocks and asymmetrical channel perceptions.
