The Homogeneity Indicator of Learners in Project-based Learning

The development of ICT has emerged a new way of learning using electronic platforms: E-learning. In addition, pedagogical approaches have been adopted in teaching based on group learning, such as the project-based teaching. The project-based teaching is an active learning method, based on group work to develop skills and acquire knowledge.
