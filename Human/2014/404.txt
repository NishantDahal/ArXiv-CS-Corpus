The Art of Software Design, a Video Game for Learning Software Design Principles

This paper introduces our gamification of a part of our software design curriculum. Based on typical design principles a motivating learning game is developed to train students in software design. We use Bloom's taxonomy to determine learning objectives. We keep the player engaged with direct feedback in a challenging level based game with increasing complexity. Players can evaluate their design actions with the help of the visualisation of control and data flows. The main learning objective: applying design principles, fits the game's main activity. This supports the learning by doing approach of lecturers. A user test indicates possible learning effects and a playable game.
