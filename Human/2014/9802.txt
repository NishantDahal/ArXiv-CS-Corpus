Causal/Predictive Imperfect Channel State Information in Block-Fading Channels

We consider a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) block-fading channel with a general model for channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). The model covers systems with causal CSIT, where only CSIT of past fading blocks is available, and predictive CSIT, where CSIT of some future fading blocks is available. The optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) and rate-diversity tradeoff (RDT) of the channel are studied under long-term power constraints. The impact of imperfect (mismatched) CSIT on the optimal DMT and RDT is also investigated. Our results show the outage diversity gain obtained by providing imperfect causal/predictive CSIT, leading to new insights into system design and analysis.
