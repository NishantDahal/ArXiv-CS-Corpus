Novel and Fast Algorithm for Extracting License Plate Location Based on Edge Analysis

Nowadays in developing or developed countries, the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technology has attracted so much attention to itself. License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems have many applications in ITSs, such as the payment of parking fee, controlling the traffic volume, traffic data collection, etc. This paper presents a new and fast method for license plate extraction based on edge analysis. our proposed method consist of four stage, which are edge detection, non-useable edge and noise removing, edge analysis and morphology-based license plate extraction. In the result part, the proposed algorithm is applied on vehicle database and the accuracy rate reached 98%. From the experimental results it is shown that the proposed method gives fairly acceptable level of accuracy for practical license plate recognition system.
