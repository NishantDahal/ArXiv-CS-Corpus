Periodic Behaviors in Constrained Multi-agent Systems

In this paper, we provide two discrete-time multi-agent models which generate periodic behaviors. The first one is a multi-agent system of identical double integrators with input saturation constraints, while the other one is a multi-agent system of identical neutrally stable system with input saturation constraints. In each case, we show that if the feedback gain parameters of the local controller satisfy a certain condition, the multi-agent system exhibits a periodic solution.
