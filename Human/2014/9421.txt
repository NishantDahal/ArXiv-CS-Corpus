Verifiable Privacy-Preserving Member and Order Queries on a List

We introduce a formal model for membership and order queries on privacy-preserving authenticated lists. In this model, the queries are performed on the list stored in the cloud where data integrity and privacy have to be maintained. We then present an efficient construction of privacy-preserving authenticated lists based on bilinear accumulators and bilinear maps, analyze the performance, and prove the integrity and privacy of this construction under widely accepted assumptions.
