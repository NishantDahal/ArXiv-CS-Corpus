ChromaPhy - A Living Wearable Connecting Humans and Their Environment

This research presents an artistic project aiming to make cyberfiction become reality and exemplifying a current trend in art and science collaborations. Chroma+Phy is a speculative design for a living wearable that combines the protoplasmic structure of the amoeboid acellular organism Physarum polycephalum and the chromatophores of the reptile Chameleon. The underpin-ning idea is that in a future far away or close, on planet earth or in outer space, humans will need some tools to help them in their social life and day-to-day routine. Chroma+Phy enhances the body aiming at humans in extreme habitats for an aggression-free and healthy life. Our approach will address actual issues of scientific discovery for society and catalyse idea translation through art and design experiments at frontiers of science.
