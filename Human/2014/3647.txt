Security Thresholds of Multicarrier Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution

We prove the secret key rate formulas and derive security threshold parameters of multicarrier continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). In a multicarrier CVQKD scenario, the Gaussian input quantum states of the legal parties are granulated into Gaussian subcarrier CVs (continuous-variables). The multicarrier communication formulates Gaussian sub-channels from the physical quantum channel, each dedicated to the transmission of a subcarrier CV. The Gaussian subcarriers are decoded by a unitary CV operation, which results in the recovered single-carrier Gaussian CVs. We derive the formulas through the AMQD (adaptive multicarrier quadrature division) scheme, the SVD-assisted (singular value decomposition) AMQD, and the multiuser AMQD-MQA (multiuser quadrature allocation). We prove that the multicarrier CVQKD leads to improved secret key rates and higher tolerable excess noise in comparison to single-carrier CVQKD. We derive the private classical capacity of a Gaussian sub-channel and the security parameters of an optimal Gaussian collective attack in the multicarrier setting. We reveal the secret key rate formulas for one-way and two-way multicarrier CVQKD protocols, assuming homodyne and heterodyne measurements and direct and reverse reconciliation. The results reveal the physical boundaries of physically allowed Gaussian attacks in a multicarrier CVQKD scenario and confirm that the improved transmission rates lead to enhanced secret key rates and security thresholds.
