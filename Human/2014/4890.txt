Integrating Vague Association Mining with Markov Model

The increasing demand of world wide web raises the need of predicting the user's web page request.The most widely used approach to predict the web pages is the pattern discovery process of Web usage mining. This process involves inevitability of many techniques like Markov model, association rules and clustering. Fuzzy theory with different techniques has been introduced for the better results. Our focus is on Markov models. This paper is introducing the vague Rules with Markov models for more accuracy using the vague set theory.
