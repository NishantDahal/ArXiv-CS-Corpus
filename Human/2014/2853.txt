SNSAPI: A Cross-Platform Middleware for Rapid Deployment of Decentralized Social Networks

In this paper, we present the design, implementation and our year-long maintenance experience of SNSAPI, a Python-based middleware which unifies the interfaces and data structures of heterogeneous Social Networking Services (SNS). Unlike most prior works, our middleware is user-oriented and requires zero infrastructure support. It enables a user to readily conduct online social activities in a programmable, cross-platform fashion while gradually reducing the dependence on centralized Online Social Networks (OSN). More importantly, as the SNSAPI middleware can be used to support decentralized social networking services via conventional communication channels such as RSS or Email, it enables the deployment of Decentralized Social Networks (DSN) in an incremental, ad hoc manner. To demonstrate the viability of such type of DSNs, we have deployed an experimental 6000-node SNSAPI-based DSN on PlanetLab and evaluate its performance by replaying traces of online social activities collected from a mainstream OSN. Our results show that, with only mild resource consumption, the SNSAPI-based DSN can achieve acceptable forwarding latency comparable to that of a centralized OSN. We also develop an analytical model to characterize the trade-offs between resource consumption and message forwarding delay in our DSN. Via 20 parameterized experiments on PlanetLab, we have found that the empirical measurement results match reasonably with the performance predicted by our analytical model.
