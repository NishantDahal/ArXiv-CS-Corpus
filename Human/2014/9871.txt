Model Transformations in Practice Workshop (MTiP)

Model Transformations in Practice (MTiP) 2005 was a workshop which provided a forum for the model transformation community to discuss practical model transformation issues. Although many different model transformation approaches have been proposed and explored in recent years, there has been little work on comparing and contrasting various approaches. Without such comparisons, it is hard to assess new model transformation approaches such as the upcoming OMG MOF/QVT recommendation, or to discern sensible future paths for the area. Our aims with the workshop were to create a forum that would help lead to an increased understanding of the relative merits of different model transformation techniques and approaches. A more advanced understanding of such merits is of considerable benefit to both the model transformation and wider modelling communities.
