Algebraic Codes and a New Physical Layer Transmission Protocol for Wireless Distributed Storage Systems

In a wireless storage system, having to communicate over a fading channel makes repair transmissions prone to physical layer errors. The first approach to combat fading is to utilize the existing optimal space-time codes. However, it was recently pointed out that such codes are in general too complex to decode when the number of helper nodes is bigger than the number of antennas at the newcomer or data collector. In this paper, a novel protocol for wireless storage transmissions based on algebraic space-time codes is presented in order to improve the system reliability while enabling feasible decoding. The diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) of the system together with sphere-decodability even with low number of antennas are used as the main design criteria, thus naturally establishing a DMT-complexity tradeoff. It is shown that the proposed protocol outperforms the simple time-division multiple access (TDMA) protocol, while still falling behind the optimal DMT.
