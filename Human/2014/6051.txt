Study and Development of a Data Acquisition & Control (DAQ) System using TCP/Modbus Protocol

The aim of the project was to develop a HMI (Human-Machine Interface) with the help of which a person could remotely control and monitor the Vacuum measurement system. The Vacuum measurement system was constructed using a DAQ (Data Acquisition & Control) implementation instead of a PLC based implementation because of the cost involvement and complexity involved in deployment when only one basic parameter i.e. vacuum is required to be measured. The system is to be installed in the Superconducting Cyclotron section of VECC. The need for remote monitoring arises as during the operation of the K500 Superconducting Cyclotron, people are not allowed to enter within a certain specified range due to effective ion radiation. Using the designed software i.e. HMI the following objective of remote monitoring could be achieved effortlessly from any area which is in the safe zone. Moreover the software was designed in a way that data could be recorded real time and in an unmanned way. The hardware is also easy to setup and overcomes the complexity involved in interfacing a PLC with other hardware. The deployment time is also quite fast. Lastly, the practical results obtained showed an appreciable degree of accuracy of the system and friendliness with the user.
