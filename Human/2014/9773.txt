Coding of Stereo Signals by a Single Digital ΔΣ Modulator

The possibility of using a single digital ΔΣ modulator to simultaneously encode the two channels of a stereo signal is illustrated. From the modulated stream, the two channels can be recovered with minimal processing and no cross-talk. Notably, demultiplexing does not affect the sample-depth so that, after it, one still has a data stream suitable for directly driving a power bridge and convertible into analog by mere low-pass filtering. Furthermore, the approach is very flexible and if one channel is unused, it lets the other get improved dynamic range and SNR. The approach can take advantage of recent techniques for the design of ΔΣ modulators, including methods for psychoacoustically optimal distribution of quantization noise. Code is available to replicate the proposed examples and as a general computer aided design tool.
