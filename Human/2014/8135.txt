Acoustic Fingerprinting Revisited: Generate Stable Device ID Stealthy with Inaudible Sound

The popularity of mobile device has made people's lives more convenient, but threatened people's privacy at the same time. As end users are becoming more and more concerned on the protection of their private information, it is even harder to track a specific user using conventional technologies. For example, cookies might be cleared by users regularly. Apple has stopped apps accessing UDIDs, and Android phones use some special permission to protect IMEI code. To address this challenge, some recent studies have worked on tracing smart phones using the hardware features resulted from the imperfect manufacturing process. These works have demonstrated that different devices can be differentiated to each other. However, it still has a long way to go in order to replace cookie and be deployed in real world scenarios, especially in terms of properties like uniqueness, robustness, etc. In this paper, we presented a novel method to generate stable and unique device ID stealthy for smartphones by exploiting the frequency response of the speaker. With carefully selected audio frequencies and special sound wave patterns, we can reduce the impacts of non-linear effects and noises, and keep our feature extraction process un-noticeable to users. The extracted feature is not only very stable for a given smart phone speaker, but also unique to that phone. The feature contains rich information that is equivalent to around 40 bits of entropy, which is enough to identify billions of different smart phones of the same model. We have built a prototype to evaluate our method, and the results show that the generated device ID can be used as a replacement of cookie.
