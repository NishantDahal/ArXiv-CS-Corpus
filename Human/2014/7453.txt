Mapping R&D support infrastructures: A scientometric and webometric study of UK science parks

This thesis analyses UK SPs with an informetric approach to study (1) the role of public science and HEIs in research and development (R&D) networks associated with SPs, and (2) the web-based patterns that reflect the configuration of R&D support infrastructures associated with SPs.
