Substrate integrated waveguide power divider, circulator and coupler in [10-15] GHz band

The Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) technology is an attractive approach for the design of high performance microwave and millimeter wave components, as it combines the advantages of planar technology, such as low fabrication costs, with the low loss inherent to the waveguide solution. In this study, a substrate integrated waveguide power divider, circulator and coupler are conceived and optimized in [10-15] GHz band by Ansoft HFSS code. Thus, results of this modeling are presented, discussed and allow to integrate these devices in planar circuits.
