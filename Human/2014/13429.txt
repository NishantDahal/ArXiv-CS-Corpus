On the Power Allocation for Hybrid DF and CF Protocol with Auxiliary Parameter in Fading Relay Channels

In fading channels, power allocation over channel state may bring a rate increment compared to the fixed constant power mode. Such a rate increment is referred to power allocation gain. It is expected that the power allocation gain varies for different relay protocols. In this paper, Decode-and-Forward (DF) and Compress-and-Forward (CF) protocols are considered. We first establish a general framework for relay power allocation of DF and CF over channel state in half-duplex relay channels and present the optimal solution for relay power allocation with auxiliary parameters, respectively. Then, we reconsider the power allocation problem for one hybrid scheme which always selects the better one between DF and CF and obtain a near optimal solution for the hybrid scheme by introducing an auxiliary rate function as well as avoiding the non-concave rate optimization problem.
