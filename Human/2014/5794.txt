Digital Repository of Mathematical Formulae

The purpose of the NIST Digital Repository of Mathematical Formulae (DRMF) is to create a digital compendium of mathematical formulae for orthogonal polynomials and special functions (OPSF) and of associated mathematical data. The DRMF addresses needs of working mathematicians, physicists and engineers: providing a platform for publication and interaction with OPSF formulae on the web. Using MediaWiki extensions and other existing technology (such as software and macro collections developed for the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions), the DRMF acts as an interactive web domain for OPSF formulae. Whereas Wikipedia and other web authoring tools manifest notions or descriptions as first class objects, the DRMF does that with mathematical formulae.
