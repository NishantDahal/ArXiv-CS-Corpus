Manycore processing of repeated k-NN queries over massive moving objects observations

The ability to timely process significant amounts of continuously updated spatial data is mandatory for an increasing number of applications. In this paper we focus on a specific data-intensive problem concerning the repeated processing of huge amounts of k nearest neighbours (k-NN) queries over massive sets of moving objects, where the spatial extents of queries and the position of objects are continuously modified over time. In particular, we propose a novel hybrid CPU/GPU pipeline that significantly accelerate query processing thanks to a combination of ad-hoc data structures and non-trivial memory access patterns. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that exploits GPUs to efficiently solve repeated k-NN queries over massive sets of continuously moving objects, even characterized by highly skewed spatial distributions. In comparison with state-of-the-art sequential CPU-based implementations, our method highlights significant speedups in the order of 10x-20x, depending on the datasets, even when considering cheap GPUs.
