Linear Degrees of Freedom of MIMO Broadcast Channels with Reconfigurable Antennas in the Absence of CSIT

The K-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC) with no channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is considered, where each receiver is assumed to be equipped with reconfigurable antennas capable of choosing a subset of receiving modes from several preset modes. Under general antenna configurations, the sum linear degrees of freedom (LDoF) of the K-user MIMO BC with reconfigurable antennas is completely characterized, which corresponds to the maximum sum DoF achievable by linear coding strategies. The LDoF region is further characterized for a class of antenna configurations. Similar analysis is extended to the K-user MIMO interference channels with reconfigurable antennas and the sum LDoF is characterized for a class of antenna configurations.
