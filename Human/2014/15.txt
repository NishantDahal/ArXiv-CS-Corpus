Quantum Secure Direct Communication using Entanglement and Super Dense Coding

This paper introduces a new quantum protocol for secure direct communication. This protocol is based on Entanglement and Super-Dense coding. In this paper we present some basic definitions of entanglement in quantum mechanics, present how to use the maximally entangled states known as Bell States, and super dense coding technique to achieve secure direct message communication. Finally, we will apply some error models that could affect the transmission of the quantum data on the quantum channels, and how to treat these errors and acquire a safe transmission of the data.
