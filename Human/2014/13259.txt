Challenges and characterization of a Biological system on Grid by means of the PhyloGrid application

In this work we present a new application that is being developed. PhyloGrid is able to perform large-scale phylogenetic calculations as those that have been made for estimating the phylogeny of all the sequences already stored in the public NCBI database. The further analysis has been focused on checking the origin of the HIV-1 disease by means of a huge number of sequences that sum up to 2900 taxa. Such a study has been able to be done by the implementation of a workflow in Taverna.
