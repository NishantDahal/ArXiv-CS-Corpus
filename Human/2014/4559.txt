Branching Bisimilarity Checking for PRS

Recent studies reveal that branching bisimilarity is decidable for both nBPP (normed Basic Parallel Process) and nBPA (normed Basic Process Algebra). These results lead to the question if there are any other models in the hierarchy of PRS (Process Rewrite System) whose branching bisimilarity is decidable. It is shown in this paper that the branching bisimilarity for both nOCN (normed One Counter Net) and nPA (normed Process Algebra) is undecidable. These results essentially imply that the question has a negative answer.
