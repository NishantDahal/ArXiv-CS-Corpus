A Lightweight Identification Protocol for Embedded Devices

The task of this paper is to introduce a new lightweight identification protocol based on biometric data and elliptic curves. In fact, we combine biometric data and asymetric cryptography, namely elliptic curves and standard tools to design a multifactor identification protocol. Our scheme is light, very fast, secure and robust against all the known attacks on identification protocol. Therefore, one can use it in any constraint device such as embedded systems.
