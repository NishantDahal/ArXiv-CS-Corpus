A Symbol-Based Estimation Technique for Inter-vehicular Communication Performance Optimization

The aim of this paper is to enhance the quality of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM estimation in dedicated vehicular communication transmission V2X networks. Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment WAVE as also known IEEE 802.11p represents the standard for these networks. Developing a reliable inter-vehicular V2X communication has to focus on optimizing its real performances. In this work, we studied the fact that WAVE transmission uses the channel characteristics designed for indoor and stationary communication terminals in IEEE 802.11a. In this paper, we propose an approach to overcome this mobility problem of terminal communication. The considered solution consists in using pilot estimation technique to reduce the high bit error rate. First, we highlight the impact of rearranging the pilot symbol positions on the quality of transmission QoT. Second, we try to overcome one of the PHY layer estimation constraints by adding two new pilot symbols. By considering pilot symbol aided channel estimation at the transmitter, we focus on Least Square LS and Minimum Mean Square Error MMSE channel estimation on the receiver. A range of simulations is carried out according to ratio between the Bit Error Rate BER and the Signal to Noise Ratio SNR. We demonstrate that rearranging pilot pattern can offer better results than standardized ones. Furthermore, we prove that adding pilots symbols can provide the best performances.
