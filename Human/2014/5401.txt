A New Trust Reputation System for E-Commerce Applications

Robust Trust Reputation Systems (TRS) provide a most trustful reputation score for a specific product or service so as to support relying parties taking the right decision while interacting with an e-commerce application. Thus, TRS must rely on an appropriate architecture and suitable algorithms that are able to improve the selection, storage, generation and classification of textual feedbacks. In this work, we propose a new architecture for TRS in e-commerce applications. In fact, we propose an intelligent layer which displays to each feedback provider, who has already given his recommendation on a product, a collection of prefabricated feedbacks related to the same product. The proposed reputation algorithm generates better trust degree of the user, trust degree of the feedback and a better global reputation score of the product.
