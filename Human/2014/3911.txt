TurKPF: TurKontrol as a Particle Filter

TurKontrol, and algorithm presented in (Dai et al. 2010), uses a POMDP to model and control an iterative workflow for crowdsourced work. Here, TurKontrol is re-implemented as "TurKPF," which uses a Particle Filter to reduce computation time & memory usage. Most importantly, in our experimental environment with default parameter settings, the action is chosen nearly instantaneously. Through a series of experiments we see that TurKPF and TurKontrol perform similarly.
