Effective Secrecy: Reliability, Confusion and Stealth

A security measure called effective security is defined that includes strong secrecy and stealth communication. Effective secrecy ensures that a message cannot be deciphered and that the presence of meaningful communication is hidden. To measure stealth we use resolvability and relate this to binary hypothesis testing. Results are developed for wire-tap channels and broadcast channels with confidential messages.
