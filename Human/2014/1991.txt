Survey on software testing techniques in cloud computing

Cloud computing is the next stage of the internet evolution. It relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence on a network. It is emerged as new computing standard that impacts several different research fields, including software testing. There are various software techniques used for testing application. It not only changes the way of obtaining computing resources but also changes the way of managing and delivering computing services, technologies and solutions, meanwhile it causes new issues, challenges and needs in software testing. Software testing in cloud can reduce the need for hardware and software resources and offer a flexible and efficient alternative to the traditional software testing process. This paper provides an overview regarding trends, oppurtunities, challenges, issues, and needs in cloud testing and cloud based application.
