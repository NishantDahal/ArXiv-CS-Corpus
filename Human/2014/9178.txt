A Logic for Reasoning about Upper Probabilities

We present a propositional logic to reason about the uncertainty of events, where the uncertainty is modeled by a set of probability measures assigning an interval of probability to each event. We give a sound and complete axiomatization for the logic, and show  that the satisfiability problem is NP-complete, no harder than satisfiability for propositional logic.
