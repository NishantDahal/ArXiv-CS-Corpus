Multi-Parameter Decision Support with Data Transmission over GSM/GPRS Network: a Case Study of Landslide Monitoring

The planet Earth has hundreds of impact events, with some occurrences causing both in terms of human casualty as well as economic losses. Such attitudes of earth pushed the frontiers to develop innovative monitoring strategies for the earth system. To make that real, although, will require coherent and real-time data by observing the earth behavior contiguously. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) appears to be the best suitable infrastructure to sense environmental parameters of our interests. In this event of earth observation, another important issue is the monitoring system with high level of precision. There are different types of sensors to measure the behavioral aspects of earth. The sensors integrated with WSN, provide an accurate and contiguous data for analysis and interpretation. This paper briefly addresses earth observation and areas of critical importance to people and society. A case study has also been carried out for disaster like Landslide in the North Eastern region of India. Application software has been developed for the said study for online data acquisition and analysis with pre-disaster early warning system. The system monitors the changing geotechnical condition of this region using various geo-technical sensors like Rain gauge, In-place Inclinometer, Tilt-meter, Piezo-meter and Crack meter. This paper also touches upon the aspects of data transmission over Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) / General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) to a remote data center.
