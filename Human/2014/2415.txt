Relativistic Coulomb Integrals and Zeilberger's Holonomic Systems Approach II

We derive the recurrence relations for relativistic Coulomb integrals directly from the integral representations with the help of computer algebra methods. In order to manage the computational complexity of this problem, we employ holonomic closure properties in a sophisticated way.
