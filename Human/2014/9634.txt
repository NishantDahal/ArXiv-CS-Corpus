Local implementations of non-local quantum gates in linear entangled channel

In this paper, we demonstrate n-party controlled unitary gate implementations locally on arbitrary remote state through linear entangled channel where control parties share entanglement with the adjacent control parties and only one of them shares entanglement with the target party. In such a network, we describe the protocol of simultaneous implementation of controlled-Hermitian gate starting from three party scenario. We also explicate the implementation of three party controlled-Unitary gate, a generalized form of Toffoli gate and subsequently generalize the protocol for n-party using minimal cost.
