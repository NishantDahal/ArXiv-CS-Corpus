Comments on "A New Method to Compute the 2-Adic Complexity of Binary Sequences"

We show that there is a very simple approach to determine the 2-adic complexity of periodic binary sequences with ideal two-level autocorrelation. This is the first main result by H. Xiong, L. Qu, and C. Li, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 60, no. 4, pp. 2399-2406, Apr. 2014, and the main result by T. Tian and W. Qi, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 56, no. 1, pp. 450-454, Jan. 2010.
