Simulation and Measurement Based Vehicle-to-Vehicle Channel Characterization: Accuracy and Constraint Analysis

In this paper, a deterministic channel model for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, is compared against channel measurement data collected during a V2V channel measurement campaign using a channel sounder. Channel metrics such as channel gain, delay and Doppler spreads, eigenvalue decomposition and antenna correlations are derived from the ray tracing (RT) simulations as well as from the measurement data obtained from two different measurements in an urban four-way intersection scenario. The channel metrics are compared separately for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) situation. Most power contributions arise from the LOS component (if present) as well as from multipaths with single bounce reflections. Measurement and simulation results show a very good agreement in the presence of LOS, as most of the received power is contributed from the LOS component. In NLOS, the difference is large because the ray tracer is unable to capture some of the multi bounced propagation paths that are present in the measurements. Despite the limitations of the ray-based propagation model identified in this work, the model is suitable to characterize the channel properties in a sufficient manner.
