A Moving Least Squares Based Approach for Contour Visualization of Multi-Dimensional Data

Analysis of high dimensional data is a common task. Often, small multiples are used to visualize 1 or 2 dimensions at a time, such as in a scatterplot matrix. Associating data points between different views can be difficult though, as the points are not fixed. Other times, dimensional reduction techniques are employed to summarize the whole dataset in one image, but individual dimensions are lost in this view. In this paper, we present a means of augmenting a dimensional reduction plot with isocontours to reintroduce the original dimensions. By applying this to each dimension in the original data, we create multiple views where the points are consistent, which facilitates their comparison. Our approach employs a combination of a novel, graph-based projection technique with a GPU accelerated implementation of moving least squares to interpolate space between the points. We also present evaluations of this approach both with a case study and with a user study.
