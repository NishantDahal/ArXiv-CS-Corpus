Quantile Representation for Indirect Immunofluorescence Image Classification

In the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, an important task is to classify images of slides containing several HEp-2 cells. All cells from one slide share the same label, and by classifying cells from one slide independently, some information on the global image quality and intensity is lost. Considering one whole slide as a collection (a bag) of feature vectors, however, poses the problem of how to handle this bag. A simple, and surprisingly effective, approach is to summarize the bag of feature vectors by a few quantile values per feature. This characterizes the full distribution of all instances, thereby assuming that all instances in a bag are informative. This representation is particularly useful when each bag contains many feature vectors, which is the case in the classification of the immunofluorescence images. Experiments on the classification of indirect immunofluorescence images show the usefulness of this approach.
