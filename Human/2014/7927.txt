Improved Results on Integral and Zero-correlation Linear Cryptanalysis of the Block Cipher MIBS

MIBS is a light weight block cipher aimed at extremely constrained resources environments such as RFID tags and sensor networks. In this paper, we focus on improved key-recovery attacks on reduced-round MIBS with integral and zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis. By exploring the key-expanding properties and choosing suitable linear approximations with zero-correlation,13-round zero-correlation linear cryptanalysis were presented. Furthermore, we deduced some integral distinguishers from 8-round zero-correlation linear approximations using the relations between them, and as applications, we applied these integral distinguishers to the cryptanalysis of MIBS.
