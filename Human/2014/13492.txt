How little data is enough? Phase-diagram analysis of sparsity-regularized X-ray CT

We introduce phase-diagram analysis, a standard tool in compressed sensing, to the X-ray CT community as a systematic method for determining how few projections suffice for accurate sparsity-regularized reconstruction. In compressed sensing a phase diagram is a convenient way to study and express certain theoretical relations between sparsity and sufficient sampling. We adapt phase-diagram analysis for empirical use in X-ray CT for which the same theoretical results do not hold. We demonstrate in three case studies the potential of phase-diagram analysis for providing quantitative answers to questions of undersampling: First we demonstrate that there are cases where X-ray CT empirically performs comparable with an optimal compressed sensing strategy, namely taking measurements with Gaussian sensing matrices. Second, we show that, in contrast to what might have been anticipated, taking randomized CT measurements does not lead to improved performance compared to standard structured sampling patterns. Finally, we show preliminary results of how well phase-diagram analysis can predict the sufficient number of projections for accurately reconstructing a large-scale image of a given sparsity by means of total-variation regularization.
