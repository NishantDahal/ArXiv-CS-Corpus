Irregular Interval Valued Fuzzy Graphs

In this paper, we define irregular interval-valued fuzzy graphs and their various classifications. Size of regular interval-valued fuzzy graphs is derived. The relation between highly and neighbourly irregular interval-valued fuzzy graphs are established. Some basic theorems related to the stated graphs have also been presented.
