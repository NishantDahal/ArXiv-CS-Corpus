Ensemble Sensing on Smart Werables for a better Telehealth System

Telehealth offers interesting avenues for improving healthcare access in vulnerable populations through use of electronic devices in the patient's home that monitor and assess for early complications. However, complication of operation and poor reliability hinders the wide acceptability of telehealth services. We propose ensemble sensing on everyday wearable devices, which does not impose the burden of carrying wearable sensors, yet offers a seamless and simple platform to deliver telehealth services.
