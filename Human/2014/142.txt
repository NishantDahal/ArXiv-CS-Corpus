Computing the Kullback-Leibler Divergence between two Generalized Gamma Distributions

We derive a closed form solution for the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two generalized gamma distributions. These notes are meant as a reference and provide a guided tour towards a result of practical interest that is rarely explicated in the literature.
