Integration of Inter-Connectivity of Information System (i3) using Web Services

The growth and development of institutions day by day especially universities are increasing very large number of peoples including employees as well as students, working on different domain in distance between multiple integrated institutes, and degrading the overall efficiency of system that cannot facilitate better interoperability and automated integration. In many universities, exist system does not have yet set of connections, in spite of the fact they have different systems running on different platforms in different administrative units or departments. University of Sindh (UoS) is the one of them. In this paper we discuss about Integration of Inter-Connectivity of Information System (i3) in the UoS which is based on Service Oriented Architecture with web services. The proposed system (i3) can monitor and exchange students information in support of verification along heterogeneous and decentralized nature, and provide capability of interoperability in the place of already deployed system in the UoS using different Languages as well as Databases.
