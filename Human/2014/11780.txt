Reverse Split Rank

The reverse split rank of an integral polyhedron P is defined as the supremum of the split ranks of all rational polyhedra whose integer hull is P. Already in R^3 there exist polyhedra with infinite reverse split rank. We give a geometric characterization of the integral polyhedra in R^n with infinite reverse split rank.
