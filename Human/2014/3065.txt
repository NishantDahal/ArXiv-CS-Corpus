Protograph-Based Raptor-Like LDPC Codes

This paper proposes a class of rate-compatible LDPC codes, called protograph-based Raptor-like (PBRL) codes. The construction is focused on binary codes for BI-AWGN channels. As with the Raptor codes, additional parity bits are produced by exclusive-OR operations on the precoded bits, providing extensive rate compatibility. Unlike Raptor codes, the structure of each additional parity bit in the protograph is explicitly designed through density evolution. The construction method provides low iterative decoding thresholds and the lifted codes result in excellent error rate performance for long-blocklength PBRL codes. For short-blocklength PBRL codes the protograph design and lifting must avoid undesired graphical structures such as trapping sets and absorbing sets while also seeking to minimize the density evolution threshold. Simulation results are shown in information block sizes of $k=192$, $16368$ and $16384$. Comparing at the same information block size of $k=16368$ bits, the PBRL codes outperform the best known standardized code, the AR4JA codes in the waterfall region. The PBRL codes also perform comparably to DVB-S2 codes even though the DVB-S2 codes use LDPC codes with longer blocklengths and are concatenated with outer BCH codes.
