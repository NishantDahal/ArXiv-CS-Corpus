Visualization of Object Oriented Modeling from the Perspective of Set theory

Language is a medium for communication of our thoughts. Natural language is too wide to conceive and formulate the thoughts and ideas in a precise way. As science and technology grows, the necessity of languages arouses through which the thoughts are expressed in a better manner. Set Theory is such a mathematical language for expressing the thought of interest in a realistic way. It is well suited for presenting object oriented solution model, since this implementation methodology analyzes and modulates the requirements in a realistic way. Since the design flaws are one of the factors for software failure, industries are focusing on minimizing the design defects through better solution modeling techniques and quality assessment practices. The Object Oriented (OO) solution space can be visualized using the language of Set theory with which the design architecture of modules can be well defined. It provides a strong base to quantify the relationships within and between the modules, which is a mode for measuring the complexity of solution design of any software projects. This paper provides a visualization of OO modeling from the perspective of Set theory. Thereby, it paves the path for the designers to effectively design the application which is one of the challenges of a project development. Further, this mode of visualization enables one to effectively measure and controls the design complexity leading towards reducing the design flaws and enhanced software quality.
