Unraveling simplicity in elementary cellular automata

We show that a large number of elementary cellular automata are computationally simple. This work is the first systematic classification of elementary cellular automata based on a formal notion of computational complexity. Thanks to the generality of communication complexity, the perspectives of our method include its application to other natural systems such as neural networks and gene regulatory networks.
