Designing an Ontology for the Data Documentation Initiative

An ontology of the DDI 3 data model will be designed by following the ontology engineering methodology to be evolved based on state-of-the-art methodologies. Hence DDI 3 data and metadata can be represented in form of a standard web interchange format RDF and processed by highly available RDF tools. As a consequence the DDI community has the possibility to publish and link LOD data sets to become part of the LOD cloud.
