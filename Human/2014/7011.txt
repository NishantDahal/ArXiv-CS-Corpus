Deterministic Rateless Codes for BSC

A rateless code encodes a finite length information word into an infinitely long codeword such that longer prefixes of the codeword can tolerate a larger fraction of errors. A rateless code achieves capacity for a family of channels if, for every channel in the family, reliable communication is obtained by a prefix of the code whose rate is arbitrarily close to the channel's capacity. As a result, a universal encoder can communicate over all channels in the family while simultaneously achieving optimal communication overhead. In this paper, we construct the first \emph{deterministic} rateless code for the binary symmetric channel. Our code can be encoded and decoded in $O(β)$ time per bit and in almost logarithmic parallel time of $O(β\log n)$, where $β$ is any (arbitrarily slow) super-constant function. Furthermore, the error probability of our code is almost exponentially small $\exp(-Ω(n/β))$. Previous rateless codes are probabilistic (i.e., based on code ensembles), require polynomial time per bit for decoding, and have inferior asymptotic error probabilities. Our main technical contribution is a constructive proof for the existence of an infinite generating matrix that each of its prefixes induce a weight distribution that approximates the expected weight distribution of a random linear code.
