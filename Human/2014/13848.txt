Evaluating arbitration and conflict resolution mechanisms in the Spanish Wikipedia

In open collaborative projects like Wikipedia, interactions among users can produce tension and misunderstandings. Complex disputes require more sophisticated mechanisms of conflict resolution. In this paper, we examine the case of the Spanish Wikipedia and its Arbitration Committee, known as CRC, over its two years of activity. We postulate that the high percentage of rejections of cases presented by non-administrators, the lack of diversity inside the committee (composed only by administrators), and the high number of cases involving administrators played a central role in its eventual downfall. We conclude that mechanisms that fail to acknowledge the ecosystem they are part of cannot succceed. Therefore, further research is needed to determine if granting more decision-making power to non-administrators may lead to more effective conflict resolution mechanisms.
