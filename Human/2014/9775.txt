Radar in-Band Interference Effects on Macrocell LTE Uplink Deployments in the U.S. 3.5 GHz Band

National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has proposed vast exclusions zones between radar and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) systems which are also being considered as geographic separations between radars and 3.5 GHz Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems without investigating any changes induced by the distinct nature of LTE as opposed to WiMAX. This paper performs a detailed system-level analysis of the interference effects from shipborne radar systems into LTE systems. Even though the results reveal impacts of radar interference on LTE systems performance, they provide clear indications of conspicuously narrower exclusion zones for LTE vis-Ã -vis those of WiMAX and pave the way toward deploying LTE at 3.5 GHz within the coastline populous areas.
