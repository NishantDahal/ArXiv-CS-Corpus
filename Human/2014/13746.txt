An Important Corollary for the Fast Solution of Dynamic Maximal Clique Enumeration Problems

In this paper we modify an algorithm for updating a maximal clique enumeration after an edge insertion to provide an algorithm that runs in linear time with respect to the number of cliques containing one of the edge's endpoints, whereas existing algorithms take quadratic time.
