A wireless hand-held platform for robotic behavior control

The need for customizable properties in autonomous robotic platforms, such as in-home nursing care for the elderly and parallel implementations of human-to-machine control interfaces creates an opportunity to introduce methods deploying commonly available mobile devices running robotic command applications in managed code. This paper will discuss a human-to-machine interface and demonstrate a prototype consisting of a mobile device running a configurable application communicating with a mobile robot using a managed, type-safe language, C#.NET, over Bluetooth.
