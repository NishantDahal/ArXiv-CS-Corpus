Measuring the impact of cognitive distractions on driving performance using time series analysis

Using current sensing technology, a wealth of data on driving sessions is potentially available through a combination of vehicle sensors and drivers' physiology sensors (heart rate, breathing rate, skin temperature, etc.). Our hypothesis is that it should be possible to exploit the combination of time series produced by such multiple sensors during a driving session, in order to (i) learn models of normal driving behaviour, and (ii) use such models to detect important and potentially dangerous deviations from the norm in real-time, and thus enable the generation of appropriate alerts. Crucially, we believe that such models and interventions should and can be personalised and tailor-made for each individual driver. As an initial step towards this goal, in this paper we present techniques for assessing the impact of cognitive distraction on drivers, based on simple time series analysis. We have tested our method on a rich dataset of driving sessions, carried out in a professional simulator, involving a panel of volunteer drivers. Each session included a different type of cognitive distraction, and resulted in multiple time series from a variety of on-board sensors as well as sensors worn by the driver. Crucially, each driver also recorded an initial session with no distractions. In our model, such initial session provides the baseline times series that make it possible to quantitatively assess driver performance under distraction conditions.
