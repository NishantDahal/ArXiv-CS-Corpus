A Novel Method for the Recognition of Isolated Handwritten Arabic Characters

There are many difficulties facing a handwritten Arabic recognition system such as unlimited variation in human handwriting, similarities of distinct character shapes, interconnections of neighbouring characters and their position in the word. The typical Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are based mainly on three stages, preprocessing, features extraction and recognition. This paper proposes new methods for handwritten Arabic character recognition which is based on novel preprocessing operations including different kinds of noise removal also different kind of features like structural, Statistical and Morphological features from the main body of the character and also from the secondary components. Evaluation of the accuracy of the selected features is made. The system was trained and tested by back propagation neural network with CENPRMI dataset. The proposed algorithm obtained promising results as it is able to recognize 88% of our test set accurately. In Comparable with other related works we find that our result is the highest among other published works.
