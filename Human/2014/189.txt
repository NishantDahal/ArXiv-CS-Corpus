Nested Polar Codes Achieve the Shannon Rate-Distortion Function and the Shannon Capacity

It is shown that nested polar codes achieve the Shannon rate-distortion function for arbitrary (binary or non-binary) discrete memoryless sources and the Shannon capacity of arbitrary discrete memoryless channels.
