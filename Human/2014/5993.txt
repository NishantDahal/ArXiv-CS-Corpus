In-Band Full-Duplex Wireless: Challenges and Opportunities

In-band full-duplex (IBFD) operation has emerged as an attractive solution for increasing the throughput of wireless communication systems and networks. With IBFD, a wireless terminal is allowed to transmit and receive simultaneously in the same frequency band. This tutorial paper reviews the main concepts of IBFD wireless. Because one the biggest practical impediments to IBFD operation is the presence of self-interference, i.e., the interference caused by an IBFD node's own transmissions to its desired receptions, this tutorial surveys a wide range of IBFD self-interference mitigation techniques. Also discussed are numerous other research challenges and opportunities in the design and analysis of IBFD wireless systems.
