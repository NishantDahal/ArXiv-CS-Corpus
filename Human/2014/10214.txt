A cirquent calculus system with clustering and ranking

Cirquent calculus is a new proof-theoretic and semantic approach introduced by G.Japaridze for the needs of his theory of computability logic. The earlier article "From formulas to cirquents in computability logic" by Japaridze generalized the concept of cirquents to the version with what are termed clusterng and ranking, and showed that, through cirquents with clustering and ranking, one can capture, refine and generalize the so called extended IF logic. Japaridze's treatment of extended IF logic, however, was purely semantical, and no deductive system was proposed. The present paper syntactically constructs a cirquent calculus system with clustering and ranking, sound and complete w.r.t. the propositional fragment of cirquent-based semantics. Such a system can be considered not only a conservative extension of classical propositional logic but also, when limited to cirquents with no more than 2 ranks, an axiomatization of purely propositional extended IF logic in its full generality.
