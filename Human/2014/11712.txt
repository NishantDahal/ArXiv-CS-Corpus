Optimized Training Design for Multi-Antenna Wireless Energy Transfer in Frequency-Selective Channel

This paper studies the optimal training design for a multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless energy transfer (WET) system in frequency-selective channels, where the frequency-diversity and energy-beamforming gains can be both achieved by properly learning the channel state information (CSI) at the energy transmitter (ET). By exploiting channel reciprocity, a two-phase channel training scheme is proposed to achieve the diversity and beamforming gains, respectively. In the first phase, pilot signals are sent from the energy receiver (ER) over a selected subset of the available frequency sub-bands, through which the sub-band that exhibits the largest sum-power over all the antennas at the ET is determined and its index is sent back to the ER. In the second phase, the selected sub-band is further trained for the ET to estimate the multi-antenna channel and implement energy beamforming. We propose to maximize the net energy harvested at the ER, which is the total harvested energy offset by that used for the two-phase channel training. The optimal training design, including the number of sub-bands trained and the energy allocated for each of the two phases, is derived.
