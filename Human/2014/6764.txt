Designing Complex Dynamics in Cellular Automata with Memory

Since their inception at {\it Macy conferences} in later 1940s complex systems remain the most controversial topic of inter-disciplinary sciences. The term `complex system' is the most vague and liberally used scientific term. Using elementary cellular automata (ECA), and exploiting the CA classification, we demonstrate elusiveness of `complexity' by shifting space-time dynamics of the automata from simple to complex by enriching cells with {\it memory}. This way, we can transform any ECA class to another ECA class --- without changing skeleton of cell-state transition function --- and vice versa by just selecting a right kind of memory. A systematic analysis display that memory helps `discover' hidden information and behaviour on trivial --- uniform, periodic, and non-trivial --- chaotic, complex --- dynamical systems.
