Public Auditing and Data Dynamics for Storage Security in Cloud Computing

Cloud computing has been envisioned as the next generation architecture of IT Enterprise. Using Cloud Storage,users can remotely store their data and enjoy the on demand high quality applications and services from a shared pool of configurable computing resources, without the burden local copy data storage and maintenance. It moves the application of software data stored to the centralized large data centers, where the management of the data stored services may not be completely trusted. There are many new security challenges and the problems taken into account for ensuring the integrity of data storage in Cloud Computing. In particular, we consider the task of allowing a third party auditor (TPA) to perform verifies the integrity of the dynamic data stored in the cloud.
