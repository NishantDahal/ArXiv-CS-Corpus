An Algebraical Model for Gray Level Images

In this paper we propose a new algebraical model for the gray level images. It can be used for digital image processing. The model adresses to those images which are generated in improper light conditions (very low or high level). The vector space structure is able to illustrate some features into the image using modified level of contrast and luminosity. Also, the defined structure could be used in image enhancement. The general approach is presented with experimental results to demonstrate image enhancement.
