Security Enhancement of Biometric Authentication Scheme for Telecare Medicine Information Systems with Nonce

Telecare medicine information systems (TMIS) present the platform to deliver clinical service door to door. The technological advances in mobile computing are enhancing the quality of healthcare and a user can access these services using its mobile device. Existing authentication schemes for TMIS are either vulnerable to attacks or they have higher computational cost. We propose a biometric based efficient authentication scheme for TMIS which only requires the computation of the hash and XOR functions.
