Carbon Nanotube Based Delay Model For High Speed Energy Efficient on Chip Data Transmission Using: Current Mode Technique

Speed is a major concern for high density VLSI networks. In this paper the closed form delay model for current mode signalling in VLSI interconnects has been proposed with resistive load termination. RLC interconnect line is modelled using characteristic impedance of transmission line and inductive effect. The inductive effect is dominant at lower technology node is modelled into an equivalent resistance. In this model first order transfer function is designed using finite difference equation, and by applying the boundary conditions at the source and load termination. It has been observed that the dominant pole determines system response and delay in the proposed model. Using CNIA tool (carbon nanotube interconnect analyzer) the interconnect line parameters has been estimated at 45nm technology node. The novel proposed current mode model superiority has been validated for CNT type of material. It superiority factor remains to 66.66% as compared to voltage mode signalling. And current mode dissipates 0.015pJ energy where as VM consume 0.045pJ for a single bit transmission across the interconnect over CNT material. Secondly the damping factor of a lumped RLC circuit is shown to be a useful figure of merit.
