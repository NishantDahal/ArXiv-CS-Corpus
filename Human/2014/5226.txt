$Υ$-DB: Managing scientific hypotheses as uncertain data

In view of the paradigm shift that makes science ever more data-driven, we consider deterministic scientific hypotheses as uncertain data. This vision comprises a probabilistic database (p-DB) design methodology for the systematic construction and management of U-relational hypothesis DBs, viz., $Υ$-DBs. It introduces hypothesis management as a promising new class of applications for p-DBs. We illustrate the potential of $Υ$-DB as a tool for deep predictive analytics.
