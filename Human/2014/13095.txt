Hybrid Virtual network Embedding Algorithm with K-core Decomposition using Path Splitting

Network virtualization is an efficient approach of solving the ossification problem of the Internet. It has become a promising way of supporting lots of heterogeneous network onto substrate physical network. A major challenge in network virtualization is how to map multiple virtual networks onto specific nodes and links in the shared substrate network, known as virtual network embedding problem. Due to its NPhardness, many heuristic approaches have been proposed. In this thesis, we propose hybrid VN embedding algorithms that map multiple VN requests with node and link constraints with K-core decomposition using path splitting. Based on network pruning, a virtual network is decomposed to core network and edge network. The mapping process is divided into two phases: core network mapping and edge network mapping. Path splitting enables better resource utilization by allowing the substrate to accept more VN requests. It splits the available bandwidth of the path into small bandwidth to satisfy the resource constraints. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of the algorithm by splitting the path into small bandwidth. Due to path splitting proposed algorithm will accept many virtual network requests that will increase the revenue and acceptance ratio of the algorithm.
