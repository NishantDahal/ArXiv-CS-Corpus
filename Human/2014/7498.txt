An Easy yet Effective Method for Detecting Spatial Domain LSB Steganography

Digitization of image was a revolutionary step for the fields of photography and Image processing as this made the editing of images much effortless and easier. Image editing was not an issue until it was limited to corrective editing procedures used to enhance the quality of an image such as, contrast stretching, noise filtering, sharpening etc. But, it became a headache for many fields when image editing became manipulative. Digital images have become an easier source of tampering and forgery during last few decades. Today users and editing specialists, equipped with easily available image editing software, manipulate digital images with varied goals. Photo journalists often tamper photographs to give dramatic effect to their stories. Scientists and researchers use this trick to get theirs works published. Patients' diagnoses are misrepresented by manipulating medical imageries. Lawyers and Politicians use tampered images to direct the opinion of people or court to their favor.
