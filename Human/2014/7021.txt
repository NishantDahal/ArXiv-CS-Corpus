OPTICS Based Coverage in Wireless Sensor Network

This paper deals with the coverage problem of wireless sensor network. We use the density based clustering technique - OPTICS to cover a target region with less number of sensor nodes. OPTICS works well to identify the outliers, core points and it obtains the denser regions. We define a level of acceptance to find next appropriate sensor in the region. We eliminate overlapped area and obtain a decision tree to minimally cover up the target region.
