VirtuMob : Remote Desktop Virtualization Solution for Smarphones

Mobility is an important attribute in todays computing world. Mobile devices,smartphone and tablet PC are becoming an integral part of human life because they are most effective and convenient communication tools. This paper proposes a system to connect and access the desktops of remote computer systems using an android based Smartphone. Virtual Network Computing based architecture is used to develop the proposed system. Through a VirtuMob viewer provided on the users Smartphone, the user will be able to access and manipulate the desktops of remote computers. Several functionality such as viewing the desktop, mouse operations, keyboard operations, manipulation of documents can be performed from the Smartphone. VirtuMob server should be running on the remote system and it must be attached to a network. VirtuMob Accelerator is used to process the RFB frames of the desktop, perform Encoding of the frames and then relay the frames to the viewer over the internet. Several Encoding techniques are studied and analysed to determine which is best suited for the proposed system.
