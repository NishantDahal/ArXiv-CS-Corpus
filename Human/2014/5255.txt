Real Time Object Tracking Based on Inter-frame Coding: A Review

Inter-frame Coding plays significant role for video Compression and Computer Vision. Computer vision systems have been incorporated in many real life applications (e.g. surveillance systems, medical imaging, robot navigation and identity verification systems). Object tracking is a key computer vision topic, which aims at detecting the position of a moving object from a video sequence. The application of Inter-frame Coding for low frame rate video, as well as for low resolution video. Various methods based on Top-down approach just like kernel based or mean shift technique are used to track the object for video, So, Inter-frame Coding algorithms are widely adopted by video coding standards, mainly due to their simplicity and good distortion performance for object tracking.
