Block Motion Based Dynamic Texture Analysis: A Review

Dynamic texture refers to image sequences of non-rigid objects that exhibit some regularity in their movement. Videos of smoke, fire etc. fall under the category of dynamic texture. Researchers have investigated different ways to analyze dynamic textures since early nineties. Both appearance based (image intensities) and motion based approaches are investigated. Motion based approaches turn out to be more effective. A group of researchers have investigated ways to utilize the motion vectors readily available with the blocks in video codes like MGEG/H26X. In this paper we provide a review of the dynamic texture analysis methods using block motion. Research into dynamic texture analysis using block motion includes recognition, motion computation, segmentation, and synthesis. We provide a comprehensive review of these approaches.
