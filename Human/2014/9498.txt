Big Data Computing and Clouds: Trends and Future Directions

This paper discusses approaches and environments for carrying out analytics on Clouds for Big Data applications. It revolves around four important areas of analytics and Big Data, namely (i) data management and supporting architectures; (ii) model development and scoring; (iii) visualisation and user interaction; and (iv) business models. Through a detailed survey, we identify possible gaps in technology and provide recommendations for the research community on future directions on Cloud-supported Big Data computing and analytics solutions.
