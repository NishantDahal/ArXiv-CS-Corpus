Extending Contexts with Ontologies for Multidimensional Data Quality Assessment

Data quality and data cleaning are context dependent activities. Starting from this observation, in previous work a context model for the assessment of the quality of a database instance was proposed. In that framework, the context takes the form of a possibly virtual database or data integration system into which a database instance under quality assessment is mapped, for additional analysis and processing, enabling quality assessment. In this work we extend contexts with dimensions, and by doing so, we make possible a multidimensional assessment of data quality assessment. Multidimensional contexts are represented as ontologies written in Datalog+-. We use this language for representing dimensional constraints, and dimensional rules, and also for doing query answering based on dimensional navigation, which becomes an important auxiliary activity in the assessment of data. We show ideas and mechanisms by means of examples.
