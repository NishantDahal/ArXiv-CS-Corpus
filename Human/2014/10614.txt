Reinforcement Learning Based Algorithm for the Maximization of EV Charging Station Revenue

This paper presents an online reinforcement learning based application which increases the revenue of one particular electric vehicles (EV) station, connected to a renewable source of energy. Moreover, the proposed application adapts to changes in the trends of the station's average number of customers and their types. Most of the parameters in the model are simulated stochastically and the algorithm used is a Q-learning algorithm. A computer simulation was implemented which demonstrates and confirms the utility of the model.
