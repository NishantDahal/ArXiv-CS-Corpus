Implementation of an efficient RBAC in Cloud Computing using .NET environment

Cloud Computing is flourishing day by day and it will continue in developing phase until computers and internet era is in existence. While dealing with cloud computing, a number of security and traffic related issues are confronted. Load Balancing is one of the answers to these issues. RBAC deals with such an answer. The proposed technique involves the hybrid of FCFS with RBAC technique. RBAC will assign roles to the clients and clients with a particular role can only access the particular document. Hence identity management and access management are fully implemented using this technique.
