Output Privacy Protection With Pattern-Based Heuristic Algorithm

Privacy Preserving Data Mining(PPDM) is an ongoing research area aimed at bridging the gap between the collaborative data mining and data confidentiality There are many different approaches which have been adopted for PPDM, of them the rule hiding approach is used in this article. This approach ensures output privacy that prevent the mined patterns(itemsets) from malicious inference problems. An efficient algorithm named as Pattern-based Maxcover Algorithm is proposed with experimental results. This algorithm minimizes the dissimilarity between the source and the released database; Moreover the patterns protected cannot be retrieved from the released database by an adversary or counterpart even with an arbitrarily low support threshold.
