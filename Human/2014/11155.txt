On computational complexity of length embeddability of graphs

A graph $G$ is embeddable in $\mathbb{R}^d$ if vertices of $G$ can be assigned with points of $\mathbb{R}^d$ in such a way that all pairs of adjacent vertices are at the distance 1. We show that verifying embeddability of a given graph in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is NP-hard in the case $d > 2$ for all reasonable notions of embeddability.
