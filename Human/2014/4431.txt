Resistance of Statistical Attacks of Parastrophic Quasigroup Transformation

In this paper, we prove an important cryptographic property of $PE$-transformation proposed elsewhere. If $PE$-transformation is used as encrypting function then after $n$ applications of it on arbitrary message the distribution of $l$-tuples ($l=1,2,\dots, n$) is uniform. This property implies the resistance of statistical kind of attack of this transformation. For illustration of theoretical results, some experimental results are presented as well.
