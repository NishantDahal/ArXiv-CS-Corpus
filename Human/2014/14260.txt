Parallel Distributed Breadth First Search on the Kepler Architecture

We present the results obtained by using an evolution of our CUDA-based solution for the exploration, via a Breadth First Search, of large graphs. This latest version exploits at its best the features of the Kepler architecture and relies on a combination of techniques to reduce both the number of communications among the GPUs and the amount of exchanged data. The final result is a code that can visit more than 800 billion edges in a second by using a cluster equipped with 4096 Tesla K20X GPUs.
