Nothing is Certain but Doubt and Tests

Effective software safety standards will contribute to confidence, or assurance, in the safety of the systems in which the software is used. It is infeasible to demonstrate a correlation between standards and accidents, but there is an alternative view that makes standards "testable". Software projects are subject to uncertainty; good standards reduce uncertainty more than poor ones. Similarly assurance or integrity levels in standards should define an uncertainty gradient. The paper proposes an argument -based method of reasoning about uncertainty that can be used as a basis for conducting experiments (tests) to evaluate standards.
