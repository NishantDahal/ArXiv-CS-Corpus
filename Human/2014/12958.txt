Learning Algorithm for Relation-Substitutable Context-Free Languages

We generalized the class of $k,l$-substitutable languages (Yoshinala, 2008). Each language in the generalized class is closed under a good substitutability. The substitutability is defined by a recognizable equivalence relation. We show the convergence of our generalized learning algorithm. The size of the characteristic sample is smaller than Yoshinaka's.
