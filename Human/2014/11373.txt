eTutor: Online Learning for Personalized Education

Given recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence, web-based education systems have became complementary and, in some cases, viable alternatives to traditional classroom teaching. The popularity of these systems stems from their ability to make education available to a large demographics (see MOOCs). However, existing systems do not take advantage of the personalization which becomes possible when web-based education is offered: they continue to be one-size-fits-all. In this paper, we aim to provide a first systematic method for designing a personalized web-based education system. Personalizing education is challenging: (i) students need to be provided personalized teaching and training depending on their contexts (e.g. classes already taken, methods of learning preferred, etc.), (ii) for each specific context, the best teaching and training method (e.g type and order of teaching materials to be shown) must be learned, (iii) teaching and training should be adapted online, based on the scores/feedback (e.g. tests, quizzes, final exam, likes/dislikes etc.) of the students. Our personalized online system, e-Tutor, is able to address these challenges by learning how to adapt the teaching methodology (in this case what sequence of teaching material to present to a student) to maximize her performance in the final exam, while minimizing the time spent by the students to learn the course (and possibly dropouts). We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method on a real-world eTutor platform which is used for remedial training for a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) course.
