Securing vehicle communication systems by the KLJN key exchange protocol

We review the security requirements for vehicular communication networks and provide a critical assessment of some typical communication security solutions. We also propose a novel unconditionally secure vehicular communication architecture that utilizes the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) key distribution scheme.
