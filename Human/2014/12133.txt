SmartConnect: A System for the Design and Deployment of Wireless Sensor Networks

We have developed SmartConnect, a tool that addresses the growing need for the design and deployment of multihop wireless relay networks for connecting sensors to a control center. Given the locations of the sensors, the traffic that each sensor generates, the quality of service (QoS) requirements, and the potential locations at which relays can be placed, SmartConnect helps design and deploy a low- cost wireless multihop relay network. SmartConnect adopts a field interactive, iterative approach, with model based network design, field evaluation and relay augmentation per- formed iteratively until the desired QoS is met. The design process is based on approximate combinatorial optimization algorithms. In the paper, we provide the design choices made in SmartConnect and describe the experimental work that led to these choices. We provide results from some experimental deployments. Finally, we conduct an experimental study of the robustness of the network design over long time periods (as channel conditions slowly change), in terms of the relay augmentation and route adaptation required.
