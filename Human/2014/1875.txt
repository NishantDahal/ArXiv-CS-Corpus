Design and Synthesis of Ultra Low Energy Spin-Memristor Threshold Logic

A threshold logic gate (TLG) performs weighted sum of multiple inputs and compares the sum with a threshold. We propose Spin-Memeristor Threshold Logic (SMTL) gates, which employ memristive cross-bar array (MCA) to perform current-mode summation of binary inputs, whereas, the low-voltage fast-switching spintronic threshold devices (STD) carry out the threshold operation in an energy efficient manner. Field programmable SMTL gate arrays can operate at a small terminal voltage of ~50mV, resulting in ultra-low power consumption in gates as well as programmable interconnect networks. We evaluate the performance of SMTL using threshold logic synthesis. Results for common benchmarks show that SMTL based programmable logic hardware can be more than 100x energy efficient than state of the art CMOS FPGA.
