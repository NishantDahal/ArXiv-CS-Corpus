Exact correct-decoding exponent of the wiretap channel decoder

The security level of the achievability scheme for Wyner's wiretap channel model is examined from the perspective of the probability of correct decoding, $P_c$, at the wiretap channel decoder. In particular, for finite-alphabet memoryless channels, the exact random coding exponent of $P_c$ is derived as a function of the total coding rate $R_1$ and the rate of each sub-code $R_2$. Two different representations are given for this function and its basic properties are provided. We also characterize the region of pairs of rates $(R_1,R_2)$ of full security in the sense of the random coding exponent of $P_c$, in other words, the region where the exponent of this achievability scheme is the same as that of blind guessing at the eavesdropper side. Finally, an analogous derivation of the correct-decoding exponent is outlined for the case of the Gaussian channel.
