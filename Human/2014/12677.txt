An Improved Tracking using IMU and Vision Fusion for Mobile Augmented Reality Applications

Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) is becoming an important cyber-physical system application given the ubiquitous availability of mobile phones. With the need to operate in unprepared environments, accurate and robust registration and tracking has become an important research problem to solve. In fact, when MAR is used for tele-interactive applications involving large distances, say from an accident site to insurance office, tracking at both the ends is desirable and further it is essential to appropriately fuse inertial and vision sensors data. In this paper, we present results and discuss some insights gained in marker-less tracking during the development of a prototype pertaining to an example use case related to breakdown or damage assessment of a vehicle. The novelty of this paper is in bringing together different components and modules with appropriate enhancements towards a complete working system.
