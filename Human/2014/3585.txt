Texture Based Image Segmentation of Chili Pepper X-Ray Images Using Gabor Filter

Texture segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into regions with different textures containing a similar group of pixels. Detecting the discontinuity of the filter's output and their statistical properties help in segmenting and classifying a given image with different texture regions. In this proposed paper, chili x-ray image texture segmentation is performed by using Gabor filter. The texture segmented result obtained from Gabor filter fed into three texture filters, namely Entropy, Standard Deviation and Range filter. After performing texture analysis, features can be extracted by using Statistical methods. In this paper Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices and First order statistics are used as feature extraction methods. Features extracted from statistical methods are given to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Using this methodology, it is found that texture segmentation is followed by the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix feature extraction method gives a higher accuracy rate of 84% when compared with First order feature extraction method.
