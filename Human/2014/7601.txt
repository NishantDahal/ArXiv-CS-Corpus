A Framework for Facilitating Self-Regulation in Responsive Open Learning Environments

Studies have shown that the application of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) increases the effectiveness of education. However, this is quite challenging to be facilitated with learning technologies like Learning Management Systems (LMS) that lack an individualised approach as well as a right balance between the learner's freedom and guidance. Personalisation and adaptive technologies have a high potential to support SRL in Personal Learning Environments (PLE), which enable customisation and guidance of various strengths and at various levels with SRL widgets. The main contribution of our paper is a framework that integrates guidance and reflection support for SRL in PLEs. Therefore, we have elaborated an operational SRL model. On that basis we have implemented a system with a learner model, SRL widgets, monitoring and analytic tools, as well as recommendation functionalities. We present concrete examples from both informal and formal learning settings. Moreover, we present analytic results from our SRL system - lab experiments and a public installation. With such a complex setting we are coming close to the realisation of Responsive Open Learning Environments (ROLE).
