Simulation-Based Risk Reduction for Planning Inspections

Organizations that develop software have recognized that software process models are particularly useful for maintaining a high standard of quality. In the last decade, simulations of software processes were used in several settings and environments. This paper gives a short overview of the benefits of software process simulation and describes the development of a discrete-event model, a technique rarely used before in that field. The model introduced in this paper captures the behavior of a detailed code inspection process. It aims at reducing the risks inherent in implementing inspection processes and techniques in the overall development process. The determination of the underlying cause-effect relations using data mining techniques and empirical data is explained. Finally, the paper gives an outlook on our future work.
