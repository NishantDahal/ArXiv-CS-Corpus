Distributed Detection of a Random Process over a Multiple Access Channel under Energy and Bandwidth Constraints

We analyze a binary hypothesis testing problem built on a wireless sensor network (WSN) for detecting a stationary random process distributed both in space and time with circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution under the Neyman-Pearson framework. Using an analog scheme, the sensors transmit different linear combinations of their measurements through a multiple access channel (MAC) to reach the fusion center (FC), whose task is to decide whether the process is present or not. Considering an energy constraint on each node transmission and a limited amount of channel uses, we compute the miss error exponent of the proposed scheme using Large Deviation Theory (LDT) and show that the proposed strategy is asymptotically optimal (when the number of sensors approaches to infinity) among linear orthogonal schemes. We also show that the proposed scheme obtains significant energy saving in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime, which is the typical scenario of WSNs. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation of a 2-dimensional process in space validates the analytical results.
