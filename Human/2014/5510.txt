The Past and the Future of Holocaust Research: From Disparate Sources to an Integrated European Holocaust Research Infrastructure

The European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) has been set up by the European Union to create a sustainable complex of services for researchers. EHRI will bring together information about dispersed collections, based on currently more than 20 partner organisations in 13 countries and many other archives. EHRI, which brings together historians, archivists and specialists in digital humanities, strives to develop innovative on-line tools for finding, researching and sharing knowledge about the Holocaust. While connecting information about Holocaust collections, it strives to create tools and approaches applicable to other digital archival projects. The paper describes its current progress and collaboration across the disciplines involved.
