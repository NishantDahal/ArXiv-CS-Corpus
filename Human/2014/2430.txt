Graph isomorphism and adiabatic quantum computing

In the Graph Isomorphism problem two N-vertex graphs G and G' are given and the task is to determine whether there exists a permutation of the vertices of G that preserves adjacency and transforms G into G'. If yes, then G and G' are said to be isomorphic; otherwise they are non-isomorphic. The GI problem is an important problem in computer science and is thought to be of comparable difficulty to integer factorization. In this paper we present a quantum algorithm that solves arbitrary instances of GI and can also determine all automorphisms of a given graph. We show how the GI problem can be converted to a combinatorial optimization problem that can be solved using adiabatic quantum evolution. We numerically simulate the algorithm's quantum dynamics and show that it correctly: (i) distinguishes non-isomorphic graphs; (ii) recognizes isomorphic graphs; and (iii) finds all automorphisms of a given graph G. We then discuss the GI quantum algorithm's experimental implementation, and close by showing how it can be leveraged to give a quantum algorithm that solves arbitrary instances of the NP-Complete Sub-Graph Isomorphism problem.
