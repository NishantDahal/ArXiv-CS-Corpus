Direction Finding Algorithms with Joint Iterative Subspace Optimization

In this paper, a reduced-rank scheme with joint iterative optimization is presented for direction of arrival estimation. A rank-reduction matrix and an auxiliary reduced-rank parameter vector are jointly optimized to calculate the output power with respect to each scanning angle. Subspace algorithms to estimate the rank-reduction matrix and the auxiliary vector are proposed. Simulations are performed to show that the proposed algorithms achieve an enhanced performance over existing algorithms in the studied scenarios.
