Effect of Synchronizing Coordinated Base Stations on Phase Noise Estimation

In this paper, we study the problem of oscillator phase noise (PN) estimation in coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission systems. Specifically, we investigate the effect of phase synchronization between coordinated base stations (BSs) on PN estimation at the user receiver (downlink channel). In this respect, the Bayesian Cram√©r-Rao bound for PN estimation is derived which is a function of the level of phase synchronization between the coordinated BSs. Results show that quality of BS synchronization has a significant effect on the PN estimation.
