The Logic of Approximate Dependence

We extend the treatment of functional dependence, the basic concept of dependence logic, to include the possibility of dependence with a limited number of exceptions. We call this approximate dependence. The main result of the paper is a Completeness Theorem for approximate dependence atoms. We point out some problematic features of this which suggests that we should consider multi-teams, not just teams.
