Adaptive vibration suppression system: An iterative control law for a piezoelectric actuator shunted by a negative capacitor

An adaptive system for the suppression of vibration transmission using a single piezoelectric actuator shunted by a negative capacitance circuit is presented. It is known that using negative capacitance shunt, the spring constant of piezoelectric actuator can be controlled to extreme values of zero or infinity. Since the value of spring constant controls a force transmitted through an elastic element, it is possible to achieve a reduction of transmissibility of vibrations through a piezoelectric actuator by reducing its effective spring constant. The narrow frequency range and broad frequency range vibration isolation systems are analyzed, modeled, and experimentally investigated. The problem of high sensitivity of the vibration control system to varying operational conditions is resolved by applying an adaptive control to the circuit parameters of the negative capacitor. A control law that is based on the estimation of the value of effective spring constant of shunted piezoelectric actuator is presented. An adaptive system, which achieves a self-adjustment of the negative capacitor parameters is presented. It is shown that such an arrangement allows a design of a simple electronic system, which, however, offers a great vibration isolation efficiency in variable vibration conditions.
