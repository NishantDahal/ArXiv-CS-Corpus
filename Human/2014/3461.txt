Block Maps between Primitive Uniform and Pisot Substitutions

In this article, we prove that for all pairs of primitive Pisot or uniform substitutions with the same dominating eigenvalue, there exists a finite set of block maps such that every block map between the corresponding subshifts is an element of this set, up to a shift.
