Dynamic Selection of Symmetric Key Cryptographic Algorithms for Securing Data Based on Various Parameters

Most of the information is in the form of electronic data. A lot of electronic data exchanged takes place through computer applications. Therefore information exchange through these applications needs to be secure. Different cryptographic algorithms are usually used to address these security concerns. However, along with security there are other factors that need to be considered for practical implementation of different cryptographic algorithms like implementation cost and performance. This paper provides comparative analysis of time taken for encryption by seven symmetric key cryptographic algorithms (AES, DES, Triple DES, RC2, Skipjack, Blowfish and RC4) with variation of parameters like different data types, data density, data size and key sizes.
