e-commerce business models in the context of web3.0 paradigm

Web 3.0 promises to have a significant effect in users and businesses. It will change how people work and play, how companies use information to market and sell their products, as well as operate their businesses. The basic shift occurring in Web 3.0 is from information-centric to knowledge-centric patterns of computing. Web 3.0 will enable people and machines to connect, evolve, share and use knowledge on an unprecedented scale and in new ways that make our experience of the Internet better. Additionally, semantic technologies have the potential to drive significant improvements in capabilities and life cycle economics through cost reductions, improved efficiencies, enhanced effectiveness, and new functionalities that were not possible or economically feasible before. In this paper we look to the semantic web and Web 3.0 technologies as enablers for the creation of value and appearance of new business models. For that, we analyze the role and impact of Web 3.0 in business and we identify nine potential business models, based in direct and undirected revenue sources, which have emerged with the appearance of semantic web technologies.
