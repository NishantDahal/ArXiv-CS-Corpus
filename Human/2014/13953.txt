The Gain of Network Coding in Wireless Sensor Networking

Wireless Sensor Networks have some well known features such as low battery consumption, changing topology awareness, open environment, non reliable radio links, etc.In this paper, we investigate the benefits of Network Coding Wireless Sensor networking, especially resiliency.One of our main concern is the resiliency in Wireless Sensor Networks.We have seen that resiliency could be described as a multi dimensional metric \cite{5478822,erdene2011enhancing,6423640} taking parameters such as Average Delivery Ratio, Delay Efficiency, Energy Efficiency, Average Throughput and Delivery Fairness into account.Resiliency can then be graphically represented as a kiviat diagram created by the previous weighted parameters.In order to introduce these metrics, previous works have been leaded on the Random Gradient Based Routing, which proved good resiliency in malicious environment.We look for seeing the improvements in term of resiliency, when adding network coding in the Random Gradient Based Routing with malicious nodes.
