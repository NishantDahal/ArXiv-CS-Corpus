Non-Elitist Genetic Algorithm as a Local Search Method

Sufficient conditions are found under which the iterated non-elitist genetic algorithm with tournament selection first visits a local optimum in polynomially bounded time on average. It is shown that these conditions are satisfied on a class of problems with guaranteed local optima (GLO) if appropriate parameters of the algorithm are chosen.
