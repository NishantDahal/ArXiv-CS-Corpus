Four Layered Approach to Non-Functional Requirements Analysis

Identification of non-functional requirements is important for successful development and deployment of the software product. The acceptance of the software product by the customer depends on the non-functional requirements which are incorporated in the software. For this, we need to identify all the non-functional requirements required by all stakeholders. In the literature not many approaches are available for this purpose. Hence, we have proposed a four layered analysis approach for identification of non-functional requirements. The proposed layered approach has many advantages over non-layered approach. As part of this approach some rules are also proposed to be used in each layer. The approach is applied successfully on two case studies. The identified non-functional requirements are validated using a check list and in addition the completeness of the identified non-requirements is computed using a metric.
