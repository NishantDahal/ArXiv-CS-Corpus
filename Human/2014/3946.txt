A Technology for BigData Analysis Task Description using Domain-Specific Languages

The article presents a technology for dynamic knowledge-based building of Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) to describe data-intensive scientific discovery tasks using BigData technology. The proposed technology supports high level abstract definition of analytic and simulation parts of the task as well as integration into the composite scientific solutions. Automatic translation of the abstract task definition enables seamless integration of various data sources within single solution.
