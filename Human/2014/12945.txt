Converting Reconfigurable Petri Nets to Maude

Model checking is an important aim of the theoretical computer science. It enables the verification of a model with a set of properties such as liveness, deadlock or safety. One of the typical modelling techniques are Petri nets they are well understood and can be used for a model checking. Reconfigurable Petri nets are based on a Petri nets with a set of rules. These rules can be used dynamically to change the net. Missing is the possibility to verify a reconfigurable net and properties such as deadlocks or liveness. This paper introduces a conversion from reconfigurable Petri net to Maude, that allows us to fill the gap. It presents a net transformation approach which is based on Maude's equation- and rewrite logic as well as the LTLR model checker.
