Context-Aware Analytics in MOM Applications

Manufacturing Operations Management (MOM) systems are complex in the sense that they integrate data from heterogeneous systems inside the automation pyramid. The need for context-aware analytics arises from the dynamics of these systems that influence data generation and hamper comparability of analytics, especially predictive models (e.g. predictive maintenance), where concept drift affects application of these models in the future. Recently, an increasing amount of research has been directed towards data integration using semantic context models. Manual construction of such context models is an elaborate and error-prone task. Therefore, we pose the challenge to apply combinations of knowledge extraction techniques in the domain of analytics in MOM, which comprises the scope of data integration within Product Life-cycle Management (PLM), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES). We describe motivations, technological challenges and show benefits of context-aware analytics, which leverage from and regard the interconnectedness of semantic context data. Our example scenario shows the need for distribution and effective change tracking of context information.
