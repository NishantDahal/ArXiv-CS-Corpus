Brain Tumor Detection Based On Mathematical Analysis and Symmetry Information

Image segmentation some of the challenging issues on brain magnetic resonance image tumor segmentation caused by the weak correlation between magnetic resonance imaging intensity and anatomical meaning.With the objective of utilizing more meaningful information to improve brain tumor segmentation,an approach which employs bilateral symmetry information as an additional feature for segmentation is proposed.This is motivated by potential performance improvement in the general automatic brain tumor segmentation systems which are important for many medical and scientific applications.Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging segmentation is a complex problem in the field of medical imaging despite various presented methods.MR image of human brain can be divided into several sub-regions especially soft tissues such as gray matter,white matter and cerebra spinal fluid.Although edge information is the main clue in image segmentation,it cannot get a better result in analysis the content of images without combining other information.Our goal is to detect the position and boundary of tumors automatically.Experiments were conducted on real pictures,and the results show that the algorithm is flexible and convenient.
