A survey of modern optical character recognition techniques

This report explores the latest advances in the field of digital document recognition. With the focus on printed document imagery, we discuss the major developments in optical character recognition (OCR) and document image enhancement/restoration in application to Latin and non-Latin scripts. In addition, we review and discuss the available technologies for hand-written document recognition. In this report, we also provide some company-accumulated benchmark results on available OCR engines.
