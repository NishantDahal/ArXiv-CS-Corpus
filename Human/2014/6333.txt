Use of computer by secondary school students

This paper reports on the outcomes of a survey implemented in secondary schools. The survey identified the types of access and use of computers by students. It was found that the students had significant access to computers but they were not skilled in many features of computer use. Computers were used for a range of activities, some educational and others recreational by some students. Gender differences in computer use were not seen. The study highlights the changing scenario about uses of computer technology by students.
