Cop and robber game and hyperbolicity

In this note, we prove that all cop-win graphs G in the game in which the robber and the cop move at different speeds s and s' with s'<s, are δ-hyperbolic with δ=O(s^2). We also show that the dependency between δand s is linear if s-s'=Ω(s) and G obeys a slightly stronger condition. This solves an open question from the paper (J. Chalopin et al., Cop and robber games when the robber can hide and ride, SIAM J. Discr. Math. 25 (2011) 333-359). Since any δ-hyperbolic graph is cop-win for s=2r and s'=r+2δfor any r>0, this establishes a new - game-theoretical - characterization of Gromov hyperbolicity. We also show that for weakly modular graphs the dependency between δand s is linear for any s'<s. Using these results, we describe a simple constant-factor approximation of the hyperbolicity δof a graph on n vertices in O(n^2) time when the graph is given by its distance-matrix.
