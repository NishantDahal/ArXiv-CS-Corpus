A note on groups of a family of hyperbolic tessellations

In this paper we study the word problem of groups corresponding to tessellations of the hyperbolic plane. In particular using the Fibonacci technology developed by the second author we show that groups corresponding to the pentagrid or the heptagrid are not automatic.
