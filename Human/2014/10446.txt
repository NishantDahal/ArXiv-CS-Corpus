Kolmogorov complexity and the geometry of Brownian motion

In this paper, we continue the study of the geometry of Brownian motions which are encoded by Kolmogorov-Chaitin random reals (complex oscillations). We unfold Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity in the context of Brownian motion and specifically to phenomena emerging from the random geometric patterns generated by a Brownian motion.
