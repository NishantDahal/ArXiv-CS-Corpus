On Covering a Solid Sphere with Concentric Spheres in ${\mathbb Z}^3$

We show that a digital sphere, constructed by the circular sweep of a digital semicircle (generatrix) around its diameter, consists of some holes (absentee-voxels), which appear on its spherical surface of revolution. This incompleteness calls for a proper characterization of the absentee-voxels whose restoration will yield a complete spherical surface without any holes. In this paper, we present a characterization of such absentee-voxels using certain techniques of digital geometry and show that their count varies quadratically with the radius of the semicircular generatrix. Next, we design an algorithm to fill these absentee-voxels so as to generate a spherical surface of revolution, which is more realistic from the viewpoint of visual perception. We further show that covering a solid sphere by a set of complete spheres also results in an asymptotically larger count of absentees, which is cubic in the radius of the sphere. The characterization and generation of complete solid spheres without any holes can also be accomplished in a similar fashion. We furnish test results to substantiate our theoretical findings.
