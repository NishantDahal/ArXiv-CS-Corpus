Binary Scientific Star Coauthors Core Size

It is examined whether the relationship $ J \propto A/r^α$, and the subsequent coauthor core notion (Ausloos 2013), between the number ($J$) of joint publications (JP) by a "main scientist" (LI) with her/his coauthors (CAs) can be extended to a team-like system. This is done by considering that each coauthor can be so strongly tied to the LI that they are forming {\it binary scientific star} (BSS) systems with respect to their other collaborators. Moreover, publications in peer review journals and in "proceedings", both often thought to be of "different quality", are separetely distinguished. The role of a time interval for measuring $J$ and $α$ is also examined. New indirect measures are also introduced.
  For making the point, two LI cases with numerous CAs are studied. It is found that only a few BSS need to be usefully examined. The exponent $α$ turns out to be "second scientist" weakly dependent, but still "size" and "publication type" dependent, according to the number of CAs or JP. The CA core value is found to be (CA or JP) size and publication type dependent, but remains in an understandable range. Somewhat unexpectedly, no special qualitative difference on the binary scientific star CA core value is found between publications in peer review journals and in proceedings.
  In conclusion, some remark is made on partner cooperation in BSS teams. It is suggested that such measures can serve as criteria for distinguishing the role of scientists in a team.
