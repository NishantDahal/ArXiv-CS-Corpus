Airborne Ultrasonic Tactile Display Brain-computer Interface Paradigm

We study the extent to which contact-less and airborne ultrasonic tactile display (AUTD) stimuli delivered to the palms of a user can serve as a platform for a brain computer interface (BCI) paradigm. Six palm positions are used to evoke combined somatosensory brain responses, in order to define a novel contact-less tactile BCI. A comparison is made with classical attached vibrotactile transducers. Experiment results of subjects performing online experiments validate the novel BCI paradigm.
