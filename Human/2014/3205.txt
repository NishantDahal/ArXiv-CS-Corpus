Knowledge-Aided Reweighted Belief Propagation LDPC Decoding using Regular and Irregular Designs

In this paper a new message passing algorithm, which takes advantage of both tree-based re-parameterization and the knowledge of short cycles, is introduced for the purpose of decoding LDPC codes with short block lengths. The proposed algorithm is called variable factor appearance probability belief propagation (VFAP-BP) algorithm and is suitable for wireless communications applications, where both good decoding performance and low-latency are expected. Our simulation results show that the VFAP-BP algorithm outperforms the standard BP algorithm and requires a significantly smaller number of iterations than existing algorithms when decoding both regular and irregular LDPC codes.
