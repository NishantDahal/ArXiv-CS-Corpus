Cognitive Coordination of Global Service Delivery

Formal coordination mechanisms are of growing importance as human-based service delivery becomes more globalized and informal mechanisms are no longer effective. Further it is becoming apparent that business environments, communication among distributed teams, and work performance are all subject to endogenous and exogenous uncertainty.
  This paper describes a stochastic model of service requests in global service delivery and then puts forth a cognitive approach for coordination in the face of uncertainty, based on a perception-action loop and receding horizon control. Optimization algorithms used are a mix of myopic dynamic programming and constraint-based programming. The coordination approach described has been deployed by a globally integrated enterprise in a very large-scale global delivery system and has been demonstrated to improve work efficiency by 10-15% as compared to manual planning.
