Apple IOS Devices for Network Administrators

As tablet devices continue to gain market share at the expense of the traditional PC, they become a more integral part of the corporate landscape. Tablets are no longer being utilized only by sales executives for presentation purposes, or as addition to the traditional laptop. Users are attempting to perform significant amounts of their daily work on tablet devices, some even abandoning the ubiquitous laptop or desktop entirely. Operating exclusively from a tablet device, specifically Apple IOS tablet devices creates unique challenges in a corporate environment traditionally dominated by Microsoft Windows operating systems. Interactions with file shares, presentation media, VPN, and remote access present barriers that users and helpdesk support are unfamiliar with in a relation to an iPad or iPhone. Many solutions are being offered to these challenges some of which are analyzed by this manuscript.
