Weyl group orbit functions in image processing

We deal with the Fourier-like analysis of functions on discrete grids in two-dimensional simplexes using $C-$ and $E-$ Weyl group orbit functions. For these cases we present the convolution theorem. We provide an example of application of image processing using the $C-$ functions and the convolutions for spatial filtering of the treated image.
