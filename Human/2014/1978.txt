Recommandation mobile, sensible au contexte de contenus Ã©volutifs: Contextuel-E-Greedy

We introduce in this paper an algorithm named Contextuel-E-Greedy that tackles the dynamicity of the user's content. It is based on dynamic exploration/exploitation tradeoff and can adaptively balance the two aspects by deciding which situation is most relevant for exploration or exploitation. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms surveyed algorithms.
