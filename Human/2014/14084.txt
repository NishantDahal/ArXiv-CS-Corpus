Colorisation et texturation temps réel d'environnements urbains par système mobile avec scanner laser et caméra fish-eye

We present here a real time mobile mapping system mounted on a vehicle. The terrestrial acquisition system is based on a geolocation system and two sensors, namely, a laser scanner and a camera with a fish-eye lens. We produce 3D colored points cloud and textured models of the environment. Once the system has been calibrated, the data acquisition and processing are done "on the way". This article mainly presents our methods of colorization of point cloud, triangulation and texture mapping.
