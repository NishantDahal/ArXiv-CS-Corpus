Exploiting Model Equivalences for Solving Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagrams

We focus on  the problem of sequential decision  making in partially observable environments shared with  other agents of uncertain types having  similar or  conflicting objectives.   This problem  has been previously  formalized by multiple  frameworks one  of which  is the interactive  dynamic   influence   diagram  (I-DID),   which generalizes  the  well-known  influence  diagram to  the  multiagent setting.  I-DIDs are graphical models and may be used to compute the policy  of an agent  given its  belief over  the physical  state and others models, which changes as  the agent acts and observes in the  multiagent setting.

  As we may  expect, solving I-DIDs is computationally  hard.  This is predominantly due to the large space of candidate models ascribed to the other agents  and its exponential growth over  time.  We present two methods  for reducing the size  of the model  space and stemming its  exponential  growth.  Both  these  methods involve  aggregating individual models into equivalence classes.  Our first method groups together behaviorally equivalent models and selects only those  models for  updating which will result in  predictive behaviors that are distinct  from others  in the updated  model space.   The second method further compacts  the model space by focusing  on portions of the   behavioral  predictions.    Specifically,   we  cluster  actionally equivalent models  that prescribe identical actions at a  single  time step.  Exactly  identifying  the equivalences  would require us to solve all models in the initial set.  We avoid this by selectively  solving  some of  the  models,  thereby introducing  an approximation.    We   discuss   the   error   introduced   by   the approximation, and  empirically demonstrate the  improved efficiency in solving I-DIDs due to the equivalences.
