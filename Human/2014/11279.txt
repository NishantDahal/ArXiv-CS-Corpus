The mobile devices and its mobile learning usage analysis

The usage of mobile devices for mobile learning is becoming increasingly popular. There is a new brand of students in the universities now-a-days who are easily connected to technology and innovative mobile devices. We attempt to do an analysis on a survey done with university students on mobile device usage for mobile learning purposes. This is to find the learning trends within the student community so that some of these popular practices could be encouraged to enhance learning among the student community. Both the quantitative and qualitative approaches are adopted in the analysis. The results are discussed and conclusions drawn in the end.
