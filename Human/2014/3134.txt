Corrections to the results derived in "A Unified Approach to Algorithms Generating Unrestricted and Restricted Integer Compositions and Integer Partitions"'; and a comparison of four restricted integer composition generation algorithms

In this note, I discuss results on integer compositions/partitions given in the paper "A Unified Approach to Algorithms Generating Unrestricted and Restricted Integer Compositions and Integer Partitions". I also experiment with four different generation algorithms for restricted integer compositions and find the algorithm designed in the named paper to be pretty slow, comparatively.
  Some of my comments may be subjective.
