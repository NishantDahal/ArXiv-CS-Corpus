Quantum Clouds: A future perspective

Quantum computing and cloud computing are two giants for futuristic computing. Both technologies complement each other. Quantum clouds, therefore, is deploying the resources of quantum computation in a cloud environment to provide solution to the challenges and problems faced by present model of classical cloud computation. State of the art challenges faced by the cloud such as VM migration, data security, traffic management can be addressed by the quantum principles. But the merging of these two technologies have challenges of their own which need to be addressed before moving forward. What are those challenges and how does a quantum computer solve the cloud problems? The relation among quantum parallelism, superposition and flash crowd effect; Laundauer's principle and energy management; photon polarization principle and data security; these fascinating queries are addressed in the paper.
