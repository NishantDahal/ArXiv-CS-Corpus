Ensemble Classifiers and Their Applications: A Review

Ensemble classifier refers to a group of individual classifiers that are cooperatively trained on data set in a supervised classification problem. In this paper we present a review of commonly used ensemble classifiers in the literature. Some ensemble classifiers are also developed targeting specific applications. We also present some application driven ensemble classifiers in this paper.
