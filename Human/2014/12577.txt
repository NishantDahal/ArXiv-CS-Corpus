On the complexity of finding falsifying assignments for Herbrand disjunctions

Suppose that $Φ$ is a consistent sentence. Then there is no Herbrand proof of $\neg Φ$, which means that any Herbrand disjunction made from the prenex form of $\neg Φ$ is falsifiable. We show that the problem of finding such a falsifying assignment is hard in the following sense. For every total polynomial search problem $R$, there exists a consistent $Φ$ such that finding solutions to $R$ can be reduced to finding a falsifying assignment to an Herbrand disjunction made from $\neg Φ$. It has been conjectured that there are no complete total polynomial search problems. If this conjecture is true, then for every consistent sentence $Φ$, there exists a consistence sentence $Ψ$, such that the search problem associated with $Ψ$ cannot be reduced to the search problem associated with $Φ$.
