Buffered Simulation Games for BÃ¼chi Automata

Simulation relations are an important tool in automata theory because they provide  efficiently computable approximations to language inclusion. In recent years, extensions of ordinary simulations have been studied, for instance multi-pebble and multi-letter simulations which yield better approximations and are still polynomial-time computable.
  In this paper we study the limitations of approximating language inclusion in this way: we  introduce a natural extension of multi-letter simulations called buffered simulations. They are based on a simulation game in which the two players share a FIFO buffer of unbounded size. We consider two variants of these buffered games called continuous and look-ahead  simulation which differ in how elements can be removed from the FIFO buffer. We show that  look-ahead simulation, the simpler one, is already PSPACE-hard, i.e. computationally as hard  as language inclusion itself. Continuous simulation is even EXPTIME-hard. We also provide  matching upper bounds for solving these games with infinite state spaces.
