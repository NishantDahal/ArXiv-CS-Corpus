Integrating Heterogeneous Building and Periphery Data Models at the District Level: The NIM Approach

Integrating existing heterogeneous data models for buildings, neighbourhoods and periphery devices into a common data model that can be used by all participants, such as users, services or sensors is a cumbersome task. Usually new extended standards emerge or ontologies are used to define mappings between concrete data models. Within the COOPERaTE project a neighbourhood information model (NIM) has been developed to address interoperability and allow for various kinds of data to be stored and exchanged. The implementation of the NIM follows a meta model based approach, allowing for runtime extension and for easily integrating heterogeneous data models via a mapping DSL and code generation of adaptation components.
