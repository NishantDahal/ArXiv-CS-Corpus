Sentiment Analysis by Using Fuzzy Logic

How could a product or service is reasonably evaluated by anyone in the shortest time? A million dollar question but it is having a simple answer: Sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is consumers review on products and services which helps both the producers and consumers (stakeholders) to take effective and efficient decision within a shortest period of time. Producers can have better knowledge of their products and services through the sentiment analysis (ex. positive and negative comments or consumers likes and dislikes) which will help them to know their products status (ex. product limitations or market status). Consumers can have better knowledge of their interested products and services through the sentiment analysis (ex. positive and negative comments or consumers likes and dislikes) which will help them to know their deserving products status (ex. product limitations or market status). For more specification of the sentiment values, fuzzy logic could be introduced. Therefore, sentiment analysis with the help of fuzzy logic (deals with reasoning and gives closer views to the exact sentiment values) will help the producers or consumers or any interested person for taking the effective decision according to their product or service interest.
