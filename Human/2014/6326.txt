The Expressive Power of Modal Dependence Logic

We study the expressive power of various modal logics with team semantics. We show that exactly the properties of teams that are downward closed and closed under team k-bisimulation, for some finite k, are definable in modal logic extended with intuitionistic disjunction. Furthermore, we show that the expressive power of modal logic with intuitionistic disjunction and extended modal dependence logic coincide. Finally we establish that any translation from extended modal dependence logic into modal logic with intuitionistic disjunction increases the size of some formulas exponentially.
