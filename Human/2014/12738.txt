Intriguing Trends in Nuclear Physics Articles Authorship

The increase in authorship of nuclear physics publications has been investigated using the large statistical samples. This has been accomplished with nuclear data mining of nuclear science references (NSR) and experimental nuclear reaction (EXFOR) databases. The results of this study will be discussed and conclusions will be given.
