Abelian properties of Parry words

Abelian complexity of a word $\mathbf{u}$ is a function that counts the number of pairwise non-abelian-equivalent factors of $\mathbf{u}$ of length $n$. We prove that for any $c$-balanced Parry word $\mathbf{u}$, the values of the abelian complexity function can be computed by a finite-state automaton. The proof is based on the notion of relative Parikh vectors. The approach works for any function $F(n)$ that can be expressed in terms of the set of relative Parikh vectors corresponding to the length $n$. For example, we show that the balance function of a $c$-balanced Parry word is computable by a finite-state automaton as well.
