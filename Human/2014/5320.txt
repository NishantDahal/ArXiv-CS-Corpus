On contour representation of two dimensional patterns

Two-dimensional patterns are used in many research areas in computer science, ranging from image processing to specification and verification of complex software systems (via scenarios). The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we present the basis of a new formal representation of two-dimensional patterns based on contours and their compositions. Then, we present efficient algorithms to verify correctness of the contour-representation. Finally, we briefly discuss possible applications, in particular using them as a basic instrument in developing software tools for handling two dimensional words.
