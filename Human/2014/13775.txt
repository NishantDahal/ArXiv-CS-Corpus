LH*TH: New fast Scalable Distributed Data Structures (SDDS)

Proposed in 1993 the Scalable Distributed Data Structures (SDDSs) became a profile of basis for the data management on Multi computer. In this paper we propose an organization of a LH* bucket based on the trie hashing in order to improve times of different access request.
