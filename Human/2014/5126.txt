Simplifying Nondeterministic Finite Cover Automata

The concept of Deterministic Finite Cover Automata (DFCA) was introduced  at WIA '98, as a more compact representation than Deterministic Finite  Automata (DFA) for finite languages. In some cases representing a finite language, Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA) may significantly reduce the number of states used.  The combined power of the succinctness of the representation of finite languages using both cover languages and non-determinism has been suggested, but never  systematically studied.  In the present paper, for  nondeterministic finite cover automata (NFCA) and l-nondeterministic finite cover automaton (l-NFCA), we show that minimization can be as hard as minimizing NFAs for regular languages, even in the case of NFCAs using unary alphabets.  Moreover, we show how we can adapt the methods used to reduce, or minimize the size of NFAs/DFCAs/l-DFCAs, for simplifying NFCAs/l-NFCAs.
