Towards a Domain Specific Language for a Scene Graph based Robotic World Model

Robot world model representations are a vital part of robotic applications. However, there is no support for such representations in model-driven engineering tool chains. This work proposes a novel Domain Specific Language (DSL) for robotic world models that are based on the Robot Scene Graph (RSG) approach. The RSG-DSL can express (a) application specific scene configurations, (b) semantic scene structures and (c) inputs and outputs for the computational entities that are loaded into an instance of a world model.
