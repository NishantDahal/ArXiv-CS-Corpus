Inventions on GUI for Touch Sensitive Screens

A touch sensitive screen displays the information on the screen and also receives the input by sensing a user's touch on the same screen. This mechanism facilitates system interaction directly through the screen without needing a mouse or keyboard. This method has the advantage to make the system compact by removing keyboard, mouse and similar interactive device.
  However there are certain difficulties to implement a touch screen interface. The display screens of portable devices are becoming smaller thereby leaving lesser space for display of data, menu or touch screen interaction. Besides some screens need to display so much of information that they hardly can afford any space to display touch screen buttons. This article illustrates various inventions which have successfully eliminated these difficulties by applying appropriate Inventive principles.
