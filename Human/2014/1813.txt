Modeling of Degradation Processes in Historical Mortars

The aim of presented paper is modeling of degradation processes in historical mortars exposed to moisture impact during freezing. Internal damage caused by ice crystallization in pores is one of the most important factors limiting the service life of historical structures. Coupling the transport processes with the mechanical part will allow us to address the impact of moisture on the durability, strength and stiffness of mortars. This should be accomplished with the help of a complex thermo-hygro-mechanical model representing one of the prime objectives of this work. The proposed formulation is based on the extension of the classical poroelasticity models with the damage mechanics. An example of two-dimensional moisture transport in the environment with temperature below freezing point is presented to support the theoretical derivations.
