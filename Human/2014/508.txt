Attacks And Counterattacks On Wireless Sensor Networks

WSN is formed by autonomous nodes with partial memory, communication range, power, and bandwidth. Their occupation depends on inspecting corporal and environmental conditions and communing through a system and performing data processing. The application field is vast, comprising military, ecology, healthcare, home or commercial and require a highly secured communication. The paper analyses different types of attacks and counterattacks and provides solutions for the WSN threats
