Coded Distributed Diversity: A Novel Distributed Reception Technique for Wireless Communication Systems

In this paper, we consider a distributed reception scenario where a transmitter broadcasts a signal to multiple geographically separated receive nodes over fading channels, and each node forwards a few bits representing a processed version of the received signal to a fusion center. The fusion center then tries to decode the transmitted signal based on the forwarded information from the receive nodes and possible channel state information. We show that there is a strong connection between the problem of minimizing a symbol error probability at the fusion center in distributed reception and channel coding in coding theory. This connection allows us to design a unified framework for coded distributed diversity reception. We focus linear block codes such as simplex codes or first-order Reed-Muller codes that achieve the Griesmer bound with equality to maximize the diversity gain. Due to its simple structure, no complex offline optimization process is needed to design the coding structure at the receive nodes for the proposed coded diversity technique. The proposed technique can support a wide array of distributed reception scenarios, i.e., arbitrary $M$-ary symbol transmission at the transmitter and received signal processing with multiple bits at the receive nodes. Numerical studies show that the proposed coded diversity technique can achieve practical symbol error rates even with moderate signal-to-noise ratio and numbers of the receive nodes.
