Split Architecture for Large Scale Wide Area Networks

This report defines a carrier-grade split architecture based on requirements identified during the SPARC project. It presents the SplitArchitecture proposal, the SPARC concept for Software Defined Networking (SDN) introduced for large-scale wide area networks such as access/aggregation networks, and evaluates technical issues against architectural trade-offs. First we present the control and management architecture of the proposed SplitArchitecture. Here, we discuss a recursive control architecture consisting of hierarchically stacked control planes and provide initial considerations regarding network management integration to SDN in general and SplitArchitecture in particular. Next, OpenFlow extensions to support the carrier-grade SplitArchitecture are discussed. These are: a) Openness & Extensibility; b) Virtualization; c) OAM; d) Resiliency approaches; e) Bootstrapping and topology discovery; f) Service creation; g) Energy-efficient networking; h) QoS aspects; and i) Multilayer aspects. In addition, we discuss selected deployment and adoption scenarios faced by modern operator networks, such as service creation scenarios and peering aspects, i.e., how to interconnect with legacy networks. Finally, we indicate how our SplitArchitecture approach meets carrier grade scalability requirements in access/aggregation network scenarios
