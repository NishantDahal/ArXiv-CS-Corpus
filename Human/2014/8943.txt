Embedding of Large Boolean Functions for Reversible Logic

Reversible logic represents the basis for many emerging technologies and has recently been intensively studied. However, most of the Boolean functions of practical interest are irreversible and must be embedded into a reversible function before they can be synthesized. Thus far, an optimal embedding is guaranteed only for small functions, whereas a significant overhead results when large functions are considered. In this paper, we study this issue. We prove that determining an optimal embedding is coNP-hard already for restricted cases. Then, we propose heuristic and exact methods for determining both the number of additional lines as well as a corresponding embedding. For the approaches we considered sums of products and binary decision diagrams as function representations. Experimental evaluations show the applicability of the approaches for large functions. Consequently, the reversible embedding of large functions is enabled as a precursor to subsequent synthesis.
