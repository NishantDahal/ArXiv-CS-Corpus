Parallelism Via Concurrency at Multiple Levels

In this paper we examine the key elements determining the best performance of computing by increasing the frequency of a single chip and to get the minimum latency during execution of the programs to achieve best possible output. It is not enough to provide concurrent improvements in the hardware as Software also have to introduce concurrency in order to exploit the parallelism. The software parallelism is defined by the control and data dependency of programs whereas Hardware refers to the type of parallelism defined by the machine architecture and hardware multiplicity.
