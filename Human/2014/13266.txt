Optimization Methods for Designing Sequences with Low Autocorrelation Sidelobes

Unimodular sequences with low autocorrelations are desired in many applications, especially in the area of radar and code-division multiple access (CDMA). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to design unimodular sequences with low integrated sidelobe level (ISL), which is a widely used measure of the goodness of a sequence's correlation property. The algorithm falls into the general framework of majorization-minimization (MM) algorithms and thus shares the monotonic property of such algorithms. In addition, the algorithm can be implemented via fast Fourier transform (FFT) operations and thus is computationally efficient. Furthermore, after some modifications the algorithm can be adapted to incorporate spectral constraints, which makes the design more flexible. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing algorithms in terms of both the quality of designed sequences and the computational complexity.
