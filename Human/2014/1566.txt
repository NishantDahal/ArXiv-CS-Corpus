Control Loop Feedback Mechanism for Generic Array Logic Chip Multiprocessor

Control Loop Feedback Mechanism for Generic Array Logic Chip Multiprocessor is presented. The approach is based on control-loop feedback mechanism to maximize the efficiency on exploiting available resources such as CPU time, operating frequency, etc. Each Processing Element (PE) in the architecture is equipped with a frequency scaling module responsible for tuning the frequency of processors at run-time according to the application requirements. We show that generic array logic Chip Multiprocessors with large inter-processor First In First Outputs (First In First Outs) buffers can inherently hide much of the Generic Array Logic performance penalty while executing applications that have been mapped with few communication loops. In fact, the penalty can be driven to zero with sufficiently large First In First Outs and the removal of multiple-loop communication links. We present an example mesh-connected Generic Array Logic chip multiprocessor and show it has a less than 1% performance (throughput) reduction on average compared to the corresponding synchronous system for many DSP workloads. Furthermore, adaptive clock and voltage scaling for each processor provides an approximately 40% power savings without any performance reduction.
