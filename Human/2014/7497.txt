Survey of Parallel Computing with MATLAB

Matlab is one of the most widely used mathematical computing environments in technical computing. It has an interactive environment which provides high performance computing (HPC) procedures and easy to use. Parallel computing with Matlab has been an interested area for scientists of parallel computing researches for a number of years. Where there are many attempts to parallel Matlab. In this paper, we present most of the past,present attempts of parallel Matlab such as MatlabMPI, bcMPI, pMatlab, Star-P and PCT. Finally, we expect the future attempts.
