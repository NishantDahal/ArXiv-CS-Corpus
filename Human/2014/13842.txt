Non-termination of Dalvik bytecode via compilation to CLP

We present a set of rules for compiling a Dalvik bytecode program into a logic program with array constraints. Non-termination of the resulting program entails that of the original one, hence the techniques we have presented before for proving non-termination of constraint logic programs can be used for proving non-termination of Dalvik programs.
