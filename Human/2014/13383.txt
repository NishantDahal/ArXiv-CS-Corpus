A Novel Feature Selection and Extraction Technique for Classification

This paper presents a versatile technique for the purpose of feature selection and extraction - Class Dependent Features (CDFs). We use CDFs to improve the accuracy of classification and at the same time control computational expense by tackling the curse of dimensionality. In order to demonstrate the generality of this technique, it is applied to handwritten digit recognition and text categorization.
