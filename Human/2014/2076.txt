Destination Information Management System for Tourist

The use of information and communication technology in our day to day activities is now unavoidable. In tourism developments, destination information and management systems are used to guide visitors and provide information to both visitors and management of the tour sites. In this paper, information and navigation system was designed for tourists, taking some Niger state of Nigeria tourism destinations into account. The information management system was designed using Java Applet (NetBeans IDE 6.1), Hypertext MarkUp Language (HTML), Personal Home Page (PHP), Java script and MySQL as the back-end integration database. Two different MySQL servers were used, the MySQL query browser and the WAMP5 server to compare the effectiveness of the system developed.
