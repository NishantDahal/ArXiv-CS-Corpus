Exemplary and Complete Object Interaction Descriptions

In this paper we present a variant of message sequence diagrams called EETs Extended Event Traces We provide the graphical notation discuss the methodological use of EETs to describe behavior of object oriented business information systems and sketch their semantics Special emphasis is put on the different implications of using EETs for exemplary and complete interaction descriptions. The possibility to describe interactions between single objects as well as composite objects with EETs makes them particularly suitable to describe the behavior of large systems.
