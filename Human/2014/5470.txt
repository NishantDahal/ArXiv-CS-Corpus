Malicious User Detection in Spectrum Sensing for WRAN Using Different Outliers Detection Techniques

In cognitive radio it is of prime importance that the presence of Primary Users (PU) is detected correctly at each of the time. In order to do so the help from all present Secondary Users (SU) is taken and such a taken is known as co-operative spectrum sensing. Ideally it is assumed that all the secondary users give the correct result to the control center. But there are certain conditions under which the secondary users deliberately forward wrong result to the control center so as to degrade the performance of the cognitive network. In this paper we study the different techniques for detecting the malicious users or outliers. We take into consideration practical environmental condition such that the received signal of the secondary users is made to undergo fading and noise is also introduced in the signal. We further go on to examine each of the outlier detector techniques and find out the most suitable at various instants.
