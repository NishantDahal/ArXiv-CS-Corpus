Compressive Hyperspectral Imaging Using Progressive Total Variation

Compressed Sensing (CS) is suitable for remote acquisition of hyperspectral images for earth observation, since it could exploit the strong spatial and spectral correlations, llowing to simplify the architecture of the onboard sensors. Solutions proposed so far tend to decouple spatial and spectral dimensions to reduce the complexity of the reconstruction, not taking into account that onboard sensors progressively acquire spectral rows rather than acquiring spectral channels. For this reason, we propose a novel progressive CS architecture based on separate sensing of spectral rows and joint reconstruction employing Total Variation. Experimental results run on raw AVIRIS and AIRS images confirm the validity of the proposed system.
