Photonic spike processing: ultrafast laser neurons and an integrated photonic network

The marriage of two vibrant fields---photonics and neuromorphic processing---is fundamentally enabled by the strong analogies within the underlying physics between the dynamics of biological neurons and lasers, both of which can be understood within the framework of nonlinear dynamical systems theory. Whereas neuromorphic engineering exploits the biophysics of neuronal computation algorithms to provide a wide range of computing and signal processing applications, photonics offer an alternative approach to neuromorphic systems by exploiting the high speed, high bandwidth, and low crosstalk available to photonic interconnects which potentially grants the capacity for complex, ultrafast categorization and decision-making. Here we highlight some recent progress on this exciting field.
