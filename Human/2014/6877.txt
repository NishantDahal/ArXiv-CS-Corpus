Inherent limits on optimization and discovery in physical systems

Topological mapping of a large physical system on a graph, and its decomposition using universal measures is proposed. We find inherent limits to the potential for optimization of a given system and its approximate representations by motifs, and the ability to reconstruct the full system given approximate representations. The approximate representation of the system most suited for optimization may be different from that which most accurately describes the full system.
