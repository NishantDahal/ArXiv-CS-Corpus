The proposal of a novel software testing framework

Software testing is normally used to check the validity of a program. Test oracle performs an important role in software testing. The focus in this research is to perform class level test by introducing a testing framework. A technique is developed to generate test oracle for specification-based software testing using Vienna Development Method (VDM++) formal language. A three stage translation process, of VDM++ specifications of container classes to C++ test oracle classes, is described in this paper. It is also presented that how derived test oracle is integrated into a proposed functional testing framework. This technique caters object oriented features such as inheritance and aggregation, but concurrency is not considered in this work. Translation issues, limitations and evaluation of the technique are also discussed. The proposed approach is illustrated with the help of popular triangle problem case study.
