Experimental Study of Remote Job Submission and Execution on LRM through Grid Computing Mechanisms

Remote job submission and execution is fundamental requirement of distributed computing done using Cluster computing. However, Cluster computing limits usage within a single organization. Grid computing environment can allow use of resources for remote job execution that are available in other organizations. This paper discusses concepts of batch-job execution using LRM and using Grid. The paper discusses two ways of preparing test Grid computing environment that we use for experimental testing of concepts. This paper presents experimental testing of remote job submission and execution mechanisms through LRM specific way and Grid computing ways. Moreover, the paper also discusses various problems faced while working with Grid computing environment and discusses their trouble-shootings. The understanding and experimental testing presented in this paper would become very useful to researchers who are new to the field of job management in Grid.
