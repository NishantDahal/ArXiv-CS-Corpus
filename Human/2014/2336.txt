Scalable Frames and Convex Geometry

The recently introduced and characterized scalable frames can be considered as those frames which allow for perfect preconditioning in the sense that the frame vectors can be rescaled to yield a tight frame. In this paper we define $m$-scalability, a refinement of scalability based on the number of non-zero weights used in the rescaling process, and study the connection between this notion and elements from convex geometry. Finally, we provide results on the topology of scalable frames. In particular, we prove that the set of scalable frames with "small" redundancy is nowhere dense in the set of frames.
