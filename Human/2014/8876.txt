Wideband Waveform Design for Robust Target Detection

Future radar systems are expected to use waveforms of a high bandwidth, where the main advantage is an improved range resolution. In this paper, a technique to design robust wideband waveforms for a Multiple-Input-Single-Output system is developed. The context is optimal detection of a single object with partially unknown parameters. The waveforms are robust in the sense that, for a single transmission, detection capability is maintained over an interval of time-delay and time-scaling (Doppler) parameters. A solution framework is derived, approximated, and formulated as an optimization by means of basis expansion. In terms of probabilities of detection and false alarm, numerical evaluation shows the efficiency of the proposed method when compared with a Linear Frequency Modulated signal and a Gaussian pulse.
