On the Hegselmann-Krause conjecture in opinion dynamics

We give an elementary proof of a conjecture by Hegselmann and Krause in opinion dynamics, concerning a symmetric bounded confidence interval model: If there is a truth and all individuals take each other seriously by a positive amount bounded away from zero, then all truth seekers will converge to the truth. Here truth seekers are the individuals which are attracted by the truth by a positive amount. In the absence of truth seekers it was already shown by Hegselmann and Krause that the opinions of the individuals converge.
