Fuchsian codes for AWGN channels

We develop a new transmission scheme for additive white Gaussian noisy (AWGN) single-input single-output (SISO) channels without fading based on arithmetic Fuchsian groups. The properly discontinuous character of the action of these groups on the upper half-plane translates into logarithmic decoding complexity.
