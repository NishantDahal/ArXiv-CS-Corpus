A note on 'Exact and approximate methods for a one-dimensional minimax bin-packing problem' [Annals of Operations Research (2013) 206:611-626]

In a recent paper, Brusco, KÃ¶hn and Steinley [Ann. Oper. Res. 206:611-626 (2013)] conjecture that the 2 bins special case of the one-dimensional minimax bin-packing problem with bin size constraints might be solvable in polynomial time. In this note, we show that this problem is NP-hard for the special case and that it is strongly NP-hard for the general problem. We also propose a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for the special case and a constructive heuristic for the general problem.
