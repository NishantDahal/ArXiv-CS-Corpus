Big Spectrum Data: The New Resource for Cognitive Wireless Networking

The era of Big Data is here now, which has brought both unprecedented opportunities and critical challenges. In this article, from a perspective of cognitive wireless networking, we start with a definition of Big Spectrum Data by analyzing its characteristics in terms of six Vs, i.e., volume, variety, velocity, veracity, viability, and value. We then present a high-level tutorial on research frontiers in Big Spectrum Data analytics to guide the development of practical algorithms. We also highlight Big Spectrum Data as the new resource for cognitive wireless networking by presenting the emerging use cases.
