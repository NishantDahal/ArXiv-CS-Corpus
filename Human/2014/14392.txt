Topology of the view complex

In this paper we consider a family of simplicial complexes, which we call the view complexes. Our choice of objects of study is motivated by theoretical distributed computing, since the view complex is a key simplicial construction used for protocol complexes in the snapshot computational model. We show that the view complex $\view$ can be collapsed to the well-known complex $χ(Δ^n)$, called standard chromatic subdivision of a simplex, and that $χ(Δ^n)$ is itself collapsible. Furthermore, we show that the collapses can be performed simultaneously in entire orbits of the natural symmetric group action. Our results yield a purely combinatorial and constructive understanding of the topology of view complexes, at the same time as they enhance our knowledge about the standard chromatic subdivision of a simplex.
