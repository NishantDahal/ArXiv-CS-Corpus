View-Based Modeling of Function Nets

This paper presents an approach to model features and function nets of automotive systems comprehensively. In order to bridge the gap between feature requirements and function nets, we describe an approach to describe both using a SysML-based notation. If requirements on the automotive system are changed by several developers responsible for different features, it is important for developers to have a good overview and understanding of the functions affected. We show that this can be comprehensively modeled using so called "feature views". In order to validate these views against the complete function nets, consistency checks are provided.
