Mathematical Analysis of Temperature Accelerated Dynamics

We give a mathematical framework for temperature accelerated dynamics (TAD), an algorithm proposed by M.R. SÃ¸rensen and A.F. Voter to efficiently generate metastable stochastic dynamics. Using the notion of quasistationary distributions, we propose some modifications to TAD. Then considering the modified algorithm in an idealized setting, we show how TAD can be made mathematically rigorous.
