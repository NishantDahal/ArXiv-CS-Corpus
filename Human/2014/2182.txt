Finding Optimal Strategies of Almost Acyclic Simple Stochatic Games

The optimal value computation for turned-based stochastic games with reachability objectives, also known as simple stochastic games, is one of the few problems in $NP \cap coNP$ which are not known to be in $P$. However, there are some cases where these games can be easily solved, as for instance when the underlying graph is acyclic. In this work, we try to extend this tractability to several classes of games that can be thought as "almost" acyclic. We give some fixed-parameter tractable or polynomial algorithms in terms of different parameters such as the number of cycles or the size of the minimal feedback vertex set.
