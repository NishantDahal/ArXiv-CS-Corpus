Image Dynamic Range Enhancement in the Context of Logarithmic Models

Images of a scene observed under a variable illumination or with a variable optical aperture are not identical. Does a privileged representant exist? In which mathematical context? How to obtain it? The authors answer to such questions in the context of logarithmic models for images. After a short presentation of the model, the paper presents two image transforms: one performs an optimal enhancement of the dynamic range, and the other does the same for the mean dynamic range. Experimental results are shown.
