Joint Energy-based Detection and Classificationon of Multilingual Text Lines

This paper proposes a new hierarchical MDL-based model for a joint detection and classification of multilingual text lines in im- ages taken by hand-held cameras. The majority of related text detec- tion methods assume alphabet-based writing in a single language, e.g. in Latin. They use simple clustering heuristics specific to such texts: prox- imity between letters within one line, larger distance between separate lines, etc. We are interested in a significantly more ambiguous problem where images combine alphabet and logographic characters from multiple languages and typographic rules vary a lot (e.g. English, Korean, and Chinese). Complexity of detecting and classifying text lines in multiple languages calls for a more principled approach based on information- theoretic principles. Our new MDL model includes data costs combining geometric errors with classification likelihoods and a hierarchical sparsity term based on label costs. This energy model can be efficiently minimized by fusion moves. We demonstrate robustness of the proposed algorithm on a large new database of multilingual text images collected in the pub- lic transit system of Seoul.
