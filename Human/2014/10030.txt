Delay-Exponent of Bilayer Anytime Code

In this paper, we study the design and the delay-exponent of anytime codes over a three terminal relay network. We propose a bilayer anytime code based on anytime spatially coupled low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and investigate the anytime characteristics through density evolution analysis. By using mathematical induction technique, we find analytical expressions of the delay-exponent for the proposed code. Through comparison, we show that the analytical delay-exponent has a close match with the delay-exponent obtained from numerical results.
