Designing for the Don't Cares: A story about a sociotechnical system

This article discusses the difficulties that arose when attempting to specify and design a large scale digital learning environment for Scottish schools. This had a potential user base of about 1 million users and was intended to replace an existing, under-used system. We found that the potential system users were not interested in engaging with the project and that there were immense problems with system governance. The only technique that we found to be useful were user stories, presenting scenarios of how the system might be used by students and their teachers. The designed architecture was based around a layered set of replaceable services.
