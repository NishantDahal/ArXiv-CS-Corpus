A Perturbation Inequality for the Schatten-$p$ Quasi-Norm and Its Applications to Low-Rank Matrix Recovery

In this paper, we establish the following perturbation result concerning the singular values of a matrix: Let $A,B \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ be given matrices, and let $f:\mathbb{R}_+\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_+$ be a concave function satisfying $f(0)=0$. Then, we have $$ \sum_{i=1}^{\min\{m,n\}} \big| f(ﾏダi(A)) - f(ﾏダi(B)) \big| \le \sum_{i=1}^{\min\{m,n\}} f(ﾏダi(A-B)), $$ where $ﾏダi(\cdot)$ denotes the $i$--th largest singular value of a matrix. This answers an open question that is of interest to both the compressive sensing and linear algebra communities. In particular, by taking $f(\cdot)=(\cdot)^p$ for any $p \in (0,1]$, we obtain a perturbation inequality for the so--called Schatten $p$--quasi--norm, which allows us to confirm the validity of a number of previously conjectured conditions for the recovery of low--rank matrices via the popular Schatten $p$--quasi--norm heuristic. We believe that our result will find further applications, especially in the study of low--rank matrix recovery.
