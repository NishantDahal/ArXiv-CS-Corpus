Cancellation-Free Circuits in Unbounded and Bounded Depth

We study the notion of "cancellation-free" circuits. This is a restriction of linear Boolean circuits (XOR circuits), but can be considered as being equivalent to previously studied models of computation. The notion was coined by Boyar and Peralta in a study of heuristics for a particular circuit minimization problem. They asked how large a gap there can be between the smallest cancellation-free circuit and the smallest linear circuit. We show that the difference can be a factor $Ω(n/\log^{2}n)$. This improves on a recent result by Sergeev and Gashkov who have studied a similar problem. Furthermore, our proof holds for circuits of constant depth. We also study the complexity of computing the Sierpinski matrix using cancellation-free circuits and give a tight $Ω(n\log n)$ lower bound.
