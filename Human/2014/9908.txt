Anatomy of the Internet Peering Disputes

Internet peering disputes have had an impact on the Internet AS-graph. As a result, the customers of the ASes often suffer because they cannot reach to the all of the Internet. There is a lack of study of the disputes that have taken place so far, even though each dispute is individually well understood. In this paper, we collect data on 26 disputes from from various resources, categorise them in a systemic manner to understand them from geographical and temporal point of views. There are some ASes that are more involved in disputes than others. In the end, we conclude we need to collect more data as it would be more interesting to have data on the Internet peering disputes around the world.
