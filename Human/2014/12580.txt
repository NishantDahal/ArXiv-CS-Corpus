Efficiency of Matrix Multiplication on the Cross-Wired Mesh Array

This note looks at the efficiency of the cross-wired mesh array in the context of matrix multiplication. It is shown that in case of repeated operations, the average number of steps to multiply sets of nxn matrices on a 2D cross-wired mesh array approaches n.
