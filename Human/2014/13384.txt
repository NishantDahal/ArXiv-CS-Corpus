Home Automation Using SSVEP & Eye-Blink Detection Based Brain-Computer Interface

In this paper, we present a novel brain computer interface based home automation system using two responses - Steady State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) and the eye-blink artifact, which is augmented by a Bluetooth based indoor localization system, to greatly increase the number of controllable devices. The hardware implementation of this system to control a table lamp and table fan using brain signals has also been discussed and state-of-the-art results have been achieved.
