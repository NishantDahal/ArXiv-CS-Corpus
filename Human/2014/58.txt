Excel 2013 Spreadsheet Inquire

Excel 2013 (version 15) includes an add-in "Inquire" for auditing spreadsheets. We describe the evolution of such tools in the third-party marketplace and assess the usefulness of Microsoft's own add-in in this context. We compare in detail the features of Inquire with similar products and make suggestions for how it could be enhanced. We offer a free helper add-in that in our opinion corrects one major shortcoming of Inquire.
