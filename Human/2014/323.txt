Specification of the State Lifetime in the DEVS Formalism by Fuzzy Controller

This paper aims to develop a new approach to assess the duration of state in the DEVS formalism by fuzzy controller. The idea is to define a set of fuzzy rules obtained from observers or expert knowledge and to specify a fuzzy model which computes this duration, this latter is fed into the simulator to specify the new value in the model. In conventional model, each state is defined by a mean lifetime value whereas our method, calculates for each state the new lifetime according to inputs values. A wildfire case study is presented at the end of the paper. It is a challenging task due to its complex behavior, dynamical weather condition, and various variables involved. A global specification of the fuzzy controller and the forest fire model are presented in the DEVS formalism and comparison between conventional and fuzzy method is illustrated.
