Time-domain multiscale shape identification in electro-sensing

This paper presents premier and innovative time-domain multi-scale method for shape identification in electro-sensing using pulse-type signals. The method is based on transform-invariant shape descriptors computed from filtered polarization tensors at multi-scales. The proposed algorithm enjoys a remarkable noise robustness even with far-field measurements at very limited angle of view. It opens a door for pulsed imaging using echolocation and induction data.
