Quantum codes from affine variety codes and their subfield-subcodes

We use affine variety codes and their subfield-subcodes for obtaining quantum stabilizer codes via the CSS code construction. With this procedure, we get codes with good parameters and a code whose parameters exceed the CSS quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound given by Feng and Ma.
