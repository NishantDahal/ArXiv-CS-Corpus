A short proof for the polyhedrality of the Chvátal-Gomory closure of a compact convex set

Recently Schrijver's open problem, whether the Chvátal--Gomory closure of an irrational polytope is polyhedral was answered independently in the affirmative by Dadush, Dey, and Vielma (even for arbitrarily compact convex set) as well as by Dunkel and Schulz. We present a very short, easily accesible proof that the Chvátal--Gomory closure of a compact convex set is a polytope.
