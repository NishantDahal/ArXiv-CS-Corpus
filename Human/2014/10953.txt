Proceedings Eleventh Workshop on User Interfaces for Theorem Provers

The UITP workshop series brings together researchers interested in designing, developing and evaluating user interfaces for automated reasoning tools, such as interactive proof assistants, automated theorem provers, model finders, tools for formal methods, and tools for visualising and manipulating logical formulas and proofs. The eleventh edition of UITP took place in Vienna, Austria, and was part of the Vienna Summer of Logic, the largest ever joint conference in the area of Logic. This proceedings contains the eight contributed papers that were accepted for presentation at the workshop as well as the two invited papers.
