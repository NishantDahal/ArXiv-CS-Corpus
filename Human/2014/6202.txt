Social Technologies for Developing Collective Intelligence in Networked Society

The scientific problem in our project is defined as a question: how social technologies could contribute to the development of smart and inclusive society? The subject of our research are networked projects (virtual CI systems) which include collective decision making tools and innovation mechanisms allowing and encouraging individual and team creativity, entrepreneurship, online collaboration, new forms of self-regulation and self-governance, self-configuration of communities by considering these projects as being catalyst for emergence of CI. The answers to these theoretical questions could have huge practical implications by influencing more reasonable and sophisticated application of social technologies in practice.
