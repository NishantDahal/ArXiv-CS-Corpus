Universal Lyndon Words

A word $w$ over an alphabet $Σ$ is a Lyndon word if there exists an order defined on $Σ$ for which $w$ is lexicographically smaller than all of its conjugates (other than itself). We introduce and study \emph{universal Lyndon words}, which are words over an $n$-letter alphabet that have length $n!$ and such that all the conjugates are Lyndon words. We show that universal Lyndon words exist for every $n$ and exhibit combinatorial and structural properties of these words. We then define particular prefix codes, which we call Hamiltonian lex-codes, and show that every Hamiltonian lex-code is in bijection with the set of the shortest unrepeated prefixes of the conjugates of a universal Lyndon word. This allows us to give an algorithm for constructing all the universal Lyndon words.
