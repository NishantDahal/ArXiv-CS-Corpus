Dynamic Cluster Head Node Election (DCHNE) Model over Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)

WSNs are becoming an appealing research area due to their several application domains. The performance of WSNs depends on the topology of sensors and their ability to adapt to changes in the network. Sensor nodes are often resource constrained by their limited power, less communication distance capacity, and restricted sensing capability. Therefore, they need to cooperate with each other to accomplish a specific task. Thus, clustering enables sensor nodes to communicate through the cluster head node for continuous communication process. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic cluster head election mechanism. Each node in the cluster calculates its residual energy value to determine its candidacy to become the Cluster Head Node (CHN). With this mechanism, each sensor node compares its residual energy level to other nodes in the same cluster. Depending on the residual energy level the sensor node acts as the next cluster head. Evaluation of the dynamic CHN election mechanism is conducted using network simulator-2 (ns2). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach prolongs the network lifetime and balancing the energy
