CLAZY: Lazy Calling for Common Lisp

This document contains a description of a Common Lisp extension that allows a programmer to write functional programs that use "normal order" evaluation, as in "non-strict" languages like Haskell. The extension is relatively straightforward, and it appears to be the first one such that is integrated in the overall Common Lisp framework.
