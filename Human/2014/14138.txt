Analysis of WiFi and WiMAX and Wireless Network Coexistence

Wireless networks are very popular nowadays. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) that uses the IEEE 802.11 standard and WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) that uses the IEEE 802.16 standard are networks that we want to explore. WiMAX has been developed over 10 years, but it is still unknown to most people. However compared to WLAN, it has many advantages in transmission speed and coverage area. This paper will introduce these two technologies and make comparisons between WiMAX and WiFi. In addition, wireless network coexistence of WLAN and WiMAX will be explored through simulation. Lastly we want to discuss the future of WiMAX in relation to WiFi.
