Some Notes on Constructions of Binary Sequences with Optimal Autocorrelation

Constructions of binary sequences with low autocorrelation are considered in the paper. Based on recent progresses about this topic, several more general constructions of binary sequences with optimal autocorrelations and other low autocorrelations are presented.
