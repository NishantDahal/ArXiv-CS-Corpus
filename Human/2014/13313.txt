From Logical to Distributional Models

The paper relates two variants of semantic models for natural language, logical functional models and compositional distributional vector space models, by transferring the logic and reasoning from the logical to the distributional models.
  The geometrical operations of quantum logic are reformulated as algebraic operations on vectors.  A map from functional models to vector space models makes it possible to compare the meaning of sentences word by word.
