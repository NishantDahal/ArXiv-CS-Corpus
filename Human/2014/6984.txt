Collection of abstracts of the Workshop on Triangulations in Geometry and Topology at CG Week 2014 in Kyoto

This workshop about triangulations of manifolds in computational geometry and topology was held at the 2014 CG-Week in Kyoto, Japan.
  It focussed on computational and combinatorial questions regarding triangulations, with the goal of bringing together researchers working on various aspects of triangulations and of fostering a closer collaboration within the computational geometry and topology community.
  Triangulations are highly suitable for computations due to their clear combinatorial structure. As a consequence, they have been successfully employed in discrete algorithms to solve purely theoretical problems in a broad variety of mathematical research areas (knot theory, polytope theory, 2- and 3-manifold topology, geometry, and others). However, due to the large variety of applications, requirements vary from field to field and thus different types of triangulations, different tools, and different frameworks are used in different areas of research. This is why today closely related research areas are sometimes largely disjoint leaving potential reciprocal benefits unused.
  To address these potentials a workshop on Triangulations was held at Oberwolfach Research Institute in 2012. Since then many new collaborations between researchers of different mathematical communities have been established. Regarding the computational geometry community, the theory of manifolds continues to contribute to advances in more applied areas of the field. Many researchers are interested in fundamental mathematical research about triangulations and thus will benefit from a broad set of knowledge about different research areas using different techniques.
  We hope that this workshop brought together researchers from many different fields of computational geometry to have fruitful discussions which will lead to new interdisciplinary collaborations and solutions.
