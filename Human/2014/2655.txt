Relational Mathematics Continued

This is in some sense an addendum to the book Relational Mathematics by the first-named author. It originated from work on diverse other topics during which a lot of purely relational results with broad applicability have been produced. These include results on domain construction with novel formulae for existential and inverse image, a relational calculus for binary mappings, and the development of a formally derived relational calculus of Kronecker-, strict fork-, and strict join-operators. The many visualizations in this report make it also a scrap- and picture book for examples.
