A Note on Relative Observability in Coordination Control

Relative observability has been introduced and studied in the framework of partially observed discrete-event systems as a condition stronger than observability, but weaker than normality. However, unlike observability, relative observability is closed under language unions, which makes it interesting for practical applications. In this paper, we investigate this notion in the framework of coordination control. We prove that conditional normality is a stronger condition than conditional (strong) relative observability, hence conditional strong relative observability can be used in coordination control instead of conditional normality, and present a distributive procedure for the computation of a conditionally controllable and conditionally observable sublanguage of the specification that contains the supremal conditionally strong relative observable sublanguage.
