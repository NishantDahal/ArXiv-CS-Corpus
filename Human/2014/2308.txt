Scalability of the plasma physics code GEM

We discuss a detailed weak scaling analysis of GEM, a 3D MPI-parallelised gyrofluid code used in theoretical plasma physics at the Max Planck Institute of Plasma Physics, IPP at Garching b. München, Germany. Within a PRACE Preparatory Access Project various versions of the code have been analysed on the HPC systems SuperMUC at LRZ and JUQUEEN at Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) to improve the parallel scalability of the application. The diagnostic tool Scalasca has been used to filter out suboptimal routines. The code uses the electromagnetic gyrofluid model which is a superset of magnetohydrodynamic and drift-Alfvén microturbulance and also includes several relevant kinetic processes. GEM can be used with different geometries depending on the targeted use case, and has been proven to show good scalability when the computational domain is distributed amongst two dimensions. Such a distribution allows grids with sufficient size to describe small scale tokamak devices. In order to enable simulation of very large tokamaks (such as the next generation nuclear fusion device ITER in Cadarache, France) the third dimension has been parallelised and weak scaling has been achieved for significantly larger grids.
