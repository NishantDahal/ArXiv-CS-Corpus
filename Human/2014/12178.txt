Designing Socially Intelligent Virtual Companions

Virtual companions that interact with users in a socially complex environment require a wide range of social skills. Displaying curiosity is simultaneously a factor to improve a companion's believability and to unobtrusively affect the user's activities over time. Curiosity represents a drive to know new things. It is a major driving force for engaging learners in active learning. Existing research work pays little attention in curiosity. In this paper, we enrich the social skills of a virtual companion by infusing curiosity into its mental model. A curious companion residing in a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) to stimulate user's curiosity is proposed. The curious companion model is developed based on multidisciplinary considerations. The effectiveness of the curious companion is demonstrated by a preliminary field study.
