Size Adaptive Region Based Huffman Compression Technique

A loss-less compression technique is proposed which uses a variable length Region formation technique to divide the input file into a number of variable length regions. Huffman codes are obtained for entire file after formation of regions. Symbols of each region are compressed one by one. Comparisons are made among proposed technique, Region Based Huffman compression technique and classical Huffman technique. The proposed technique offers better compression ratio for some files than other two.
