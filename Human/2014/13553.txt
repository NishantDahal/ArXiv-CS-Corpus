Py3DFreeHandUS: a library for voxel-array reconstruction using Ultrasonography and attitude sensors

In medical imaging, there is a growing interest to provide real-time images with good quality for large anatomical structures. To cope with this issue, we developed a library that allows to replace, for some specific clinical applications, more robust systems such as Computer Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Our python library Py3DFreeHandUS is a package for processing data acquired simultaneously by ultra-sonographic systems (US) and marker-based optoelectronic systems. In particular, US data enables to visualize subcutaneous body structures, whereas the optoelectronic system is able to collect the 3D position in space for reflective objects, that are called markers. By combining these two measurement devices, it is possible to reconstruct the real 3D morphology of body structures such as muscles, for relevant clinical implications. In the present research work, the different steps which allow to obtain a relevant 3D data set as well as the procedures for calibrating the systems and for determining the quality of the reconstruction.
