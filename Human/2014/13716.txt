New Bounds for the Garden-Hose Model

We show new results about the garden-hose model. Our main results include improved lower bounds based on non-deterministic communication complexity (leading to the previously unknown $Θ(n)$ bounds for Inner Product mod 2 and Disjointness), as well as an $O(n\cdot \log^3 n)$ upper bound for the Distributed Majority function (previously conjectured to have quadratic complexity). We show an efficient simulation of formulae made of AND, OR, XOR gates in the garden-hose model, which implies that lower bounds on the garden-hose complexity $GH(f)$ of the order $Ω(n^{2+ε})$ will be hard to obtain for explicit functions. Furthermore we study a time-bounded variant of the model, in which even modest savings in time can lead to exponential lower bounds on the size of garden-hose protocols.
