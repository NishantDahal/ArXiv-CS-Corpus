Proceedings Combined 21st International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency and 11th Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics

This volume contains the proceedings of the Combined 21st International Workshop on Expressiveness in Concurrency and the 11th Workshop on Structural Operational Semantics (EXPRESS/SOS 2014) which was held on 1st September 2014 in Rome, Italy, as an affiliated workshop of CONCUR 2014, the 25th International Conference on Concurrency Theory.  
  The EXPRESS workshops aim at bringing together researchers interested in the expressiveness of various formal systems and semantic notions, particularly in the field of concurrency. Their focus has traditionally been on the comparison between programming concepts (such as concurrent, functional, imperative, logic and object-oriented programming) and between mathematical models of computation (such as process algebras, Petri nets, event structures, modal logics, and rewrite systems) on the basis of their relative expressive power. The EXPRESS workshop series has run successfully since 1994 and over the years this focus has become broadly construed.  
  The SOS workshops aim at being a forum for researchers, students and practitioners interested in new developments, and directions for future investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics. One of the specific goals of the SOS workshop series is to establish synergies between the concurrency and programming language communities working on the theory and practice of SOS. Reports on applications of SOS to other fields are also most welcome, including: modelling and analysis of biological systems, security of computer systems programming, modelling and analysis of embedded systems, specification of middle-ware and coordination languages, programming language semantics and implementation, static analysis software and hardware verification, and semantics for domain-specific languages and model-based engineering.
