On the shape of subword complexity sequences of finite words

The subword complexity of a word $w$ over a finite alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ is a function that assigns for each positive integer $n$, the number of distinct subwords of length $n$ in $w$. The subword complexity of a word is a good measure of the randomness of the word and gives insight to what the word itself looks like. In this paper, we discuss the properties of subword complexity sequences, and consider different variables that influence their shape. We also compute the number of distinct subword complexity sequences for certain lengths of words over different alphabets, and state some conjectures about the growth of these numbers.
