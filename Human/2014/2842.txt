Mouse Control using a Web Camera based on Colour Detection

In this paper we present an approach for Human computer Interaction (HCI), where we have tried to control the mouse cursor movement and click events of the mouse using hand gestures. Hand gestures were acquired using a camera based on colour detection technique. This method mainly focuses on the use of a Web Camera to develop a virtual human computer interaction device in a cost effective manner.
