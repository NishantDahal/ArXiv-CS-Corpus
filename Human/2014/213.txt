Fuzzy Logic Based Multi User Adaptive Test System

The present proliferation of e-learning has been actively underway for the last 10 years. Current research in Adaptive Testing System focuses on the development of psychometric models with items selection strategies applicable to adaptive testing processes. The key aspect of proposed Adaptive Testing System is to develop an increasingly sophisticated latent trait model which can assist users in developing and enhancing their skills. Computerized Adaptive Test (CAT) System requires a lot of investment in time and effort to develop analyze and administrate an adaptive test. In this paper a fuzzy logic based Multi User Adaptive Test System (MUATS) is developed. Which is a Short Messaging Service (SMS) based System, currently integrated with GSM network based on the new psychometric model in education assessment. MUATS is not only a platform independent Adaptive Test System but also it eases the evaluation effort for adaptive test process. It further uses fuzzy logic to pick the most appropriate question from the pool of database for a specific user to be asked which makes the overall system an intelligent one.
