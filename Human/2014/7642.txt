Quantitative model-checking of controlled discrete-time Markov processes

This paper focuses on optimizing probabilities of events of interest defined over general controlled discrete-time Markov processes. It is shown that the optimization over a wide class of $Ï‰$-regular properties can be reduced to the solution of one of two fundamental problems: reachability and repeated reachability. We provide a comprehensive study of the former problem and an initial characterisation of the (much more involved) latter problem. A case study elucidates concepts and techniques.
