A Latent Space Analysis of Editor Lifecycles in Wikipedia

Collaborations such as Wikipedia are a key part of the value of the modern Internet. At the same time there is concern that these collaborations are threatened by high levels of member turnover. In this paper we borrow ideas from topic analysis to editor activity on Wikipedia over time into a latent space that offers an insight into the evolving patterns of editor behavior. This latent space representation reveals a number of different categories of editor (e.g. content experts, social networkers) and we show that it does provide a signal that predicts an editor's departure from the community. We also show that long term editors gradually diversify their participation by shifting edit preference from one or two namespaces to multiple namespaces and experience relatively soft evolution in their editor profiles, while short term editors generally distribute their contribution randomly among the namespaces and experience considerably fluctuated evolution in their editor profiles.
