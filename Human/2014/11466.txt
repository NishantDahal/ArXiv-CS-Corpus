Entropy NAND: Early Functional Completeness in Entropy Networks

An observer increases in relative entropy as it receives information from what it is observing. In a system of only an observer and the observed, an increase in the relative entropy of the observer is a decrease in the relative entropy of the observed. Linking together these directional entropy disequilibriums we show that NAND and NOR functionality arise in such networks at very low levels of complexity.
