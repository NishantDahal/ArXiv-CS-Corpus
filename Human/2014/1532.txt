Automatic Estimation of Live Coffee Leaf Infection based on Image Processing Techniques

Image segmentation is the most challenging issue in computer vision applications. And most difficulties for crops management in agriculture are the lack of appropriate methods for detecting the leaf damage for pests treatment. In this paper we proposed an automatic method for leaf damage detection and severity estimation of coffee leaf by avoiding defoliation. After enhancing the contrast of the original image using LUT based gamma correction, the image is processed to remove the background, and the output leaf is clustered using Fuzzy c-means segmentation in V channel of YUV color space to maximize all leaf damage detection, and finally, the severity of leaf is estimated in terms of ratio for leaf pixel distribution between the normal and the detected leaf damage. The results in each proposed method was compared to the current researches and the accuracy is obvious either in the background removal or damage detection.
