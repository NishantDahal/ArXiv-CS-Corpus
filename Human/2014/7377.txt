Error Correction for Physical Unclonable Functions Using Generalized Concatenated Codes

Physical Unclonable Functions can be used for secure key generation in cryptographic applications. It is explained how methods from coding theory must be applied in order to ensure reliable key regeneration. Based on previous work, we show ways how to obtain better results with respect to error probability and codeword length. Also, an example based on Generalized Concatenated codes is given, which improves upon used coding schemes for PUFs.
