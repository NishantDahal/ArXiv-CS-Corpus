Gray Codes and Overlap Cycles for Restricted Weight Words

A Gray code is a listing structure for a set of combinatorial objects such that some consistent (usually minimal) change property is maintained throughout adjacent elements in the list. While Gray codes for m-ary strings have been considered in the past, we provide a new, simple Gray code for fixed-weight m-ary strings. In addition, we consider a relatively new type of Gray code known as overlap cycles and prove basic existence results concerning overlap cycles for fixed-weight and weight-range m-ary words.
