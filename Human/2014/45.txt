Security Implications of Distributed Database Management System Models

Security features must be addressed when escalating a distributed database. The choice between the object oriented and the relational data model, several factors should be considered. The most important of these factors are single and multilevel access controls (MAC), protection and integrity maintenance. While determining which distributed database replica will be more secure for a particular function, the choice should not be made exclusively on the basis of available security features. One should also query the effectiveness and efficiency of the delivery of these characteristics. In this paper, the security strengths and weaknesses of both database models and the thorough problems initiate in the distributed environment are conversed.
