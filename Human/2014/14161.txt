BigDataViewer: Interactive Visualization and Image Processing for Terabyte Data Sets

The increasingly popular light sheet microscopy techniques generate very large 3D time-lapse recordings of living biological specimen. The necessity to make large volumetric datasets available for interactive visualization and analysis has been widely recognized. However, existing solutions build on dedicated servers to generate virtual slices that are transferred to the client applications, practically leading to insufficient frame rates (less than 10 frames per second) for truly interactive experience. An easily accessible open source solution for interactive arbitrary virtual re-slicing of very large volumes and time series of volumes has yet been missing. We fill this gap with BigDataViewer, a Fiji plugin to interactively navigate and visualize large image sequences from both local and remote data sources.
