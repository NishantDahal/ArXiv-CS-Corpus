Beamforming for Secure Communication via Untrusted Relay Nodes Using Artificial Noise

A two-phase beamforming solution for secure communication using untrusted relay nodes is presented. To thwart eavesdropping attempts of relay nodes, we deliberately introduce artificial noise in the source message. After pointing out the incongruity in evaluating secrecy rate in our model for certain scenarios, we provide an SNR based frame work for secure communication. We intend to bring down the SNR at each of the untrusted relay nodes below a certain predefined threshold, whereas, using beamforming we want to boost the SNR at the destination. With this motive optimal scaling vector is evaluated for beamforming phase which not only nullifies the artificial noise transmitted initially, but also maximizes the SNR at the destination. We discuss both the total and individual power constraint scenarios and provide analytical solution for both of them.
