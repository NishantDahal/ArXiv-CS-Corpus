Generalized weights and bounds for error probability over erasure channels

New upper and lower bounds for the error probability over an erasure channel are provided, making use of Wei's generalized weights, hierarchy and spectra. In many situations the upper and lower bounds coincide and this allows improvement of existing bounds. Results concerning MDS and AMDS codes are deduced from those bounds.
