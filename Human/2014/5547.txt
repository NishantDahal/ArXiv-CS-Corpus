Merchant Sharing Towards a Zero Marginal Cost Economy

This paper is the first attempt to formalize a new field of economics; studding the Intangibles Goods available on the Internet. We are taking advantage of the digital world's specific rules, in particular the zero marginal cost, to propose a theory of trading & sharing unified. A function based money is created as a world-wide currency; "cup". We argue that our system discourage speculation activities while it makes easy captured taxes for governments. The implementation removes the today's paywall on the Internet and provides a simple-to-use, open-source, free-of-charge, highly-secure, person-to-person, privacy-respectful, digital payment tool for citizens, using standard smart-phones with a strong authentication. Next step will be the propagation of the network application and we expect many shared benefits for the whole economics development.
