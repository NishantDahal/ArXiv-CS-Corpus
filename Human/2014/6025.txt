Distributed Business Processes - A Framework for Modeling and Execution

Commercially available business process management systems (BPMS) still suffer to support organizations to enact their business processes in an effective and efficient way. Current BPMS, in general, are based on BPMN 2.0 and/or BPEL. It is well known, that these approaches have some restrictions according modeling and immediate transfer of the model into executable code. Recently, a method for modeling and execution of business processes, named subject-oriented business process management (S-BPM), gained attention. This methodology facilitates modeling of any business process using only five symbols and allows direct execution based on such models. Further on, this methodology has a strong theoretical and formal basis realizing distributed systems; any process is defined as a network of independent and distributed agents - i.e. instances of subjects - which coordinate work through the exchange of messages. In this work, we present a framework and a prototype based on off-the-shelf technologies as a possible realization of the S-BPM methodology. We can prove and demonstrate the principal architecture concept; these results should also stimulate a discussion about actual BPMS and its underlying concepts.
