Proceedings 11th International Workshop on Formal Engineering approaches to Software Components and Architectures

The aim of the FESCA workshop is to bring together both young and senior researchers from formal methods, software engineering, and industry interested in the development and application of formal modelling approaches as well as associated analysis and reasoning techniques with practical benefits for component-based software engineering.
  Component-based software design has received considerable attention in industry and academia in the past decade. In recent years, with the emergence of new platforms (such as smartphones), new areas advocating software correctness along with new challenges have appeared. These include development of new methods and adapting existing ones to accommodate unique features of the platforms, such as inherent distribution, openness, and continuous migration. On the other hand, with the growing power of computers, more and more is possible with respect to practical applicability of modelling and specification methods as well as verification tools to real-life software, i.e, to scale to more complex systems.
  FESCA aims to address the open question of how formal methods can be applied effectively to these new contexts and challenges. The workshop is interested in both the development and application of formal methods in component-based development and tries to cross-fertilize their research and application.
