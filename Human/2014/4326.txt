The Prospects for e-Examinations in Nigeria and Australia

This paper compares the e-Examination system in Nigeria with that of Australia. We consider the experiences of working with commercial firms such as Electronic Testing Company (eTC) and using open-source software. It is important to foster good relationships with accreditation authorities (such as University Authorities, West African Examination Council (WAEC), Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) etc. and the Tasmanian Qualifications Authority) to assist in the transition from paperbased assessment to post-paper assessment. The paper also considers the relative convenience for students, administrators and lecturer/assessors; and to gauges the reliability and security of the two systems in use. It examines the challenges in conducting e-Examinations in both countries by juxtaposing the systems in the two countries and suggests ways of developing more acceptable e-Examination systems.
