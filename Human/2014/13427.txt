Communication Performance Analysis of Sampled-Data H-infinity Optimal Coupling Wave Canceler

In this manuscript, we propose a design method of digital filters which cancel coupling waves generated in single-frequency full-duplex wireless relay stations by using the sampled-data H-infinity control theory. Simulation results show effectiveness of the proposed method to communication performance from a base station to a terminal.
