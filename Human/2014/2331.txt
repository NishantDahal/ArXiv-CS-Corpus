Interference Alignment (IA) and Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) with IEEE802.11ac feedback compression: testbed results

We have implemented interference alignment (IA) and joint transmission coordinated multipoint (CoMP) on a wireless testbed using the feedback compression scheme of the new 802.11ac standard. The performance as a function of the frequency domain granularity is assessed. Realistic throughput gains are obtained by probing each spatial modulation stream with ten different coding and modulation schemes. The gain of IA and CoMP over TDMA MIMO is found to be 26% and 71%, respectively under stationary conditions. In our dense indoor office deployment, the frequency domain granularity of the feedback can be reduced down to every 8th subcarrier (2.5MHz), without sacrificing performance.
