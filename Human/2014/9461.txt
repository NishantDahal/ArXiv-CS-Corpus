Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing Using Non-Abelian Groups

In his paper Stadler develops techniques for improving the security of existing secret sharing protocols by allowing to check whether the secret shares given out by the dealer are valid. In particular, the secret sharing is executed over abelian groups. In this paper we develop similar methods over non-abelian groups.
