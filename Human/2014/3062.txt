Parsing using a grammar of word association vectors

This paper was was first drafted in 2001 as a formalization of the system described in U.S. patent U.S. 7,392,174. It describes a system for implementing a parser based on a kind of cross-product over vectors of contextually similar words. It is being published now in response to nascent interest in vector combination models of syntax and semantics. The method used aggressive substitution of contextually similar words and word groups to enable product vectors to stay in the same space as their operands and make entire sentences comparable syntactically, and potentially semantically. The vectors generated had sufficient representational strength to generate parse trees at least comparable with contemporary symbolic parsers.
