Evolutionary Optimization for Decision Making under Uncertainty

Optimizing decision problems under uncertainty can be done using a variety of solution methods. Soft computing and heuristic approaches tend to be powerful for solving such problems. In this overview article, we survey Evolutionary Optimization techniques to solve Stochastic Programming problems - both for the single-stage and multi-stage case.
