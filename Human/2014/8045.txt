Cops and Robbers, Game Theory and Zermelo's Early Results

We provide a game theoretic framework for the game of cops and robbers (CR). Within this framework we study certain assumptions which underlie the concepts of optimal strategies and capture time. We also point out a connection of these concepts to early work by Zermelo and D. Konig. Finally, we discuss the relationship between CR and related pursuit games to reachability games.
