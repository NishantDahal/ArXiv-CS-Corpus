Fast Mesh-Based Medical Image Registration

In this paper a fast triangular mesh based registration method is proposed. Having Template and Reference images as inputs, the template image is triangulated using a content adaptive mesh generation algorithm. Considering the pixel values at mesh nodes, interpolated using spline interpolation method for both of the images, the energy functional needed for image registration is minimized. The minimization process was achieved using a mesh based discretization of the distance measure and regularization term which resulted in a sparse system of linear equations, which due to the smaller size in comparison to the pixel-wise registration method, can be solved directly. Mean Squared Difference (MSD) is used as a metric for evaluating the results. Using the mesh based technique, higher speed was achieved compared to pixel-based curvature registration technique with fast DCT solver. The implementation was done in MATLAB without any specific optimization. Higher speeds can be achieved using C/C++ implementations.
