Characterization and Detection of epsilon-Berge Zhukovskii Equilibria

Berge equilibrium in the sense of Zhukovskii (Berge-Zhukovskii) is an alternate solution concept in non-cooperative game theory that formalizes cooperation in a noncooperative setting. In this paper the epsilon-Berge-Zhukovskii equilibrium is introduced and characterized by using a generative relation. A computational method for detecting epsilon-Berge-Zhukovskii equilibrium based on evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms is presented. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the results obtained.
