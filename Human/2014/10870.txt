A Probabilistic Delay Model for Bidirectional VANETs in City Environments

Routing in VANETs (Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks) is a challenging task due to large network sizes, rapidly changing topology and frequent network disconnections. State-of-the-art routing protocols tried to address these specific problems especially in city environments (vehicles constrained by road geometry, signal transmissions blocked by obstacles, degree of congestion in roads etc). It was noticed that in city scenarios codirectional roads consist of a collection of disconnected clusters because of traffic control strategies (e.g., RSU (Road Side Units), stop signs and traffic lights). In this paper, we propose an intervehicle ad-hoc routing metric called EFD (Expected Forwarding Delay) based on the vehicular traffic statistics (e.g., densities and velocities) collected on-the-fly. We derive an analytical expression for the expected size of a cluster in co-directional traffic. In case of disconnection between two co-directional clusters the opposite directional clusters are used as a bridge to propagate a message in the actual forwarding direction to reduce the delay due to carry and forward. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulation, it is shown that our link delay model provides the accurate link delay estimation in bidirectional city environments.
