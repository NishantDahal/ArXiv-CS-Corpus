A human centered perspective of E-maintenance

E-maintenance is a technology aiming to organize and structure the ICT during the whole life cycle of the product, to develop a maintenance support system that is effective and efficient. A current challenge of E-maintenance is the development of generic visualization solutions for users responsible for the maintenance. AR can be a potential technology for E-maintenance visualization, since it can bring knowledge to the real physical world, to assist the technician perform his/her work without the need to interrupt to consult manuals for information. This paper proposes a methodology for the development of advanced interfaces for human aware E-maintenance so that complex maintenance processes can be made safer, better quality, faster, anytime and anywhere.
