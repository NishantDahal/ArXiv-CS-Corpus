Digital Watermarking Techniques in Spatial and Frequency Domain

Digital watermarking is the act of hiding information in multimedia data, for the purposes of content protection or authentication. In ordinary digital watermarking, the secret information is embedded into the multimedia data (cover data) with minimum distortion of the cover data. Due to these watermarking techniques the watermark image is almost negligible visible. In this paper we will discuss about various techniques of Digital Watermarking techniques in spatial and frequency domains
