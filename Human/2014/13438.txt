Toward Refactoring of DMARF and GIPSY Case Studies -- a Team 10 SOEN6471-S14 Project Report

The intent of this report is to do a background study of the two given OSS case study systems namely GIPSY and DMARF. It is a wide research area in which different studies are being carried out to get the most out of it. It begins with a formal introduction of the two systems and advance with the complex architecture of both. GIPSY (General Intensional Programming System) is a multi-intensional programming system that delivers as a framework for compiling and executing programs written in Lucid Programming Languages. DMARF (Distributed Modular Audio Recognition Framework) is a Java based research platform that acts as a library in applications. As these systems are in their evolving phase and a lot of research is being done upon these topics, it gives us motivation to be a part of this research to get a deeper look into the architectures of both the systems. For the evaluation of quality of metrics of the two open source systems, we have used a tool namely Logiscope. It is a tool to automate the code reviews by providing information based on software metrics and graphs.
