Linked Data Integration with Conflicts

Linked Data have emerged as a successful publication format and one of its main strengths is its fitness for integration of data from multiple sources. This gives them a great potential both for semantic applications and the enterprise environment where data integration is crucial. Linked Data integration poses new challenges, however, and new algorithms and tools covering all steps of the integration process need to be developed. This paper explores Linked Data integration and its specifics. We focus on data fusion and conflict resolution: two novel algorithms for Linked Data fusion with provenance tracking and quality assessment of fused data are proposed. The algorithms are implemented as part of the ODCleanStore framework and evaluated on real Linked Open Data.
