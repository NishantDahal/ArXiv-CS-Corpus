Linear Network Coding for Multiple Groupcast Sessions: An Interference Alignment Approach

We consider the problem of linear network coding over communication networks, representable by directed acyclic graphs, with multiple groupcast sessions: the network comprises of multiple destination nodes, each desiring messages from multiple sources. We adopt an interference alignment perspective, providing new insights into designing practical network coding schemes as well as the impact of network topology on the complexity of the alignment scheme. In particular, we show that under certain (polynomial-time checkable) constraints on networks with $K$ sources, it is possible to achieve a rate of $1/(L+d+1)$ per source using linear network coding coupled with interference alignment, where each destination receives messages from $L$ sources ($L < K$), and $d$ is a parameter, solely dependent on the network topology, that satisfies $0 \leq d < K-L$.
