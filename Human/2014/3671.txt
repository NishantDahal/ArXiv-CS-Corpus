To Achieve Maximal Throughputs in CSMA Wireless Networks Through Offered_load Control

This paper studies how to achieve the maximal link throughputs in a CSMA wireless network through offered-load control. First, we propose an analytical model, contention-graph-combination (CGC), to describe the relationship between the offered-load and the output link throughputs of an unsaturated CSMA network. Based on CGC, we then formulate a linear optimization model to improve the aggregate link throughput through properly setting the occurrence probabilities of each sub-network, based on which we can obtain the optimal offered-load of each link. Simulation results bore out the accuracy of our CGC analysis and the maximal link throughputs can be closely achieved. Different from prior work in which CSMA protocol parameters are adaptively adjusted to achieve better performance, in this paper we propose to achieve maximal link throughputs by adjusting the rates of the traffic pumped into the source nodes of links, which runs in a software manner and is more practical to implement in real networks.
