An Evolutionary approach for solving Shrödinger Equation

The purpose of this paper is to present a method of solving the Shrödinger Equation (SE) by Genetic Algorithms and Grammatical Evolution. The method forms generations of trial solutions expressed in an analytical form. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method providing, for example, the results of its application to a quantum system minimal energy, and we compare these results with those produced by traditional analytical methods
