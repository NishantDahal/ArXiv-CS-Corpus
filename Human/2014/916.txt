NoSQL Databases

In this document, I present the main notions of NoSQL databases and compare four selected products (Riak, MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4J) according to their capabilities with respect to consistency, availability, and partition tolerance, as well as performance. I also propose a few criteria for selecting the right tool for the right situation.
