An Approach for Computing Dynamic Slice of Concurrent Aspect-Oriented Programs

We propose a dynamic slicing algorithm to compute the slice of concurrent aspect-oriented programs. We use a dependence based intermediate program representation called Concurrent Aspect-oriented System Dependence Graph (CASDG) to represent a concurrent aspect-oriented program. The CASDG of an aspect-oriented program consists of a system dependence graph (SDG) for the non-aspect code, a group of dependence graphs for aspect code and some additional dependence edges used to connect the system dependence graph for the non-aspect code to dependence graph for aspect code. The proposed dynamic slicing al-gorithm is an extended version of NMDS algorithm for concurrent object-oriented programs, which is based on marking and unmarking of the executed nodes in CASDG appropriately during run-time.
