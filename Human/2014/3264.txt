An Explicit Trust Model Towards Better System Security

Trust is an absolute necessity for digital communications; but is often viewed as an implicit singular entity. The use of the internet as the primary vehicle for information exchange has made accountability and verifiability of system code almost obsolete. This paper proposes a novel approach towards enforcing system security by requiring the explicit definition of trust for all operating code. By identifying the various classes and levels of trust required within a computing system; trust is defined as a combination of individual characteristics. Trust is then represented as a calculable metric obtained through the collective enforcement of each of these characteristics to varying degrees. System Security is achieved by facilitating trust to be a constantly evolving aspect for each operating code segment capable of getting stronger or weaker over time.
