Multi-Dimensional Customization Modelling Based On Metagraph For Saas Multi-Tenant Applications

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a new software delivery model in which pre-built applications are delivered to customers as a service. SaaS providers aim to attract a large number of tenants (users) with minimal system modifications to meet economics of scale. To achieve this aim, SaaS applications have to be customizable to meet requirements of each tenant. However, due to the rapid growing of the SaaS, SaaS applications could have thousands of tenants with a huge number of ways to customize applications. Modularizing such customizations still is a highly complex task. Additionally, due to the big variation of requirements for tenants, no single customization model is appropriate for all tenants. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional customization model based on metagraph. The proposed mode addresses the modelling variability among tenants, describes customizations and their relationships, and guarantees the correctness of SaaS customizations made by tenants.
