A Narrative Vehicle Protection Representation for Vehicle Speed Regulator Under Driver Exhaustion -- A Study

Driver fatigue is one of the important factors that cause traffic accidents, and the ever-increasing number due to diminished drivers vigilance level has become a problem of serious concern to society. Drivers with a diminished vigilance level suffer from a marked decline in their abilities of perception, recognition, and vehicle control, and therefore pose serious danger to their own life and the lives of other people. Exhaustion resulting from sleep deprivation or sleep disorders is an important factor in the creasing number of accidents. In this projected work, we discuss the various methods of the existing and the proposed method based on a real time online safety prototype that controls the vehicle speed under driver fatigue. The purpose of such a model is to advance a system to detect fatigue symptoms in drivers and control the speed of vehicle to avoid accidents. This system was tested adequately with subjects of different technology of various researchers finally the validity of the proposed model for vehicle speed controller based on driver fatigue detection is shown.
