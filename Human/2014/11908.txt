A Framework for Evaluation of Composite Memento Temporal Coherence

Most archived HTML pages embed other web resources, such as images and stylesheets. Playback of the archived web pages typically provides only the capture date (or Memento-Datetime) of the root resource and not the Memento-Datetime of the embedded resources. In the course of our research, we have discovered that the Memento-Datetime of embedded resources can be up to several years in the future or past, relative to the Memento-Datetime of the embedding root resource. We introduce a framework for assessing temporal coherence between a root resource and its embedded resource depending on Memento-Datetime, Last-Modified datetime, and entity body.
