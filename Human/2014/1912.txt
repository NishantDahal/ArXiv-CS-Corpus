Virtual Learning Environments-A Survey

This paper is based on the study of existing literature, highlights the current state of the work proposed to implement technically enhanced learning.
  Technology developments and network infrastructure improvements, specifically the world wide web) are providing exciting opportunities for the use of computers in all areas. These developments have fit together with an evolving role for education as more students wish to study at a distance, part time, or wish to integrate their education with their professional career. With the market becoming increasingly mature, e learning has almost become a major plank in both national and institutional strategies.
  At the same time, virtual learning system is also gaining its popularity among its users. It has brought in a great revolution in itself. In the advanced learning strategy, virtual learning systems depends on level and sector of working, usage of functions, purpose of usage, required online resources to perform computationally intensive operations such as information sharing and collaborative work. Often the institutions prefer the latest and the best technology which is cost effective and provide the best features which meet up all requirements. Virtual learning environment enables operator professional to bring together in one place a variety of prevailing resources, suchlike tasks and formative feedback, and links to law reports, statutes and journal articles, all intended at summing up value to student learning managing learning experience without the burden of communication and providing successful delivery of education and training with flexibility.
  In spite of the hype achieved by organizations in technically enhanced learning, the growth of the virtual learning systems users is still below expectations due to the risks associated with the implementation strategy and provision of technical support.
