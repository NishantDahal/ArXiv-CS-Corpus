A semantic account of strong normalization in Linear Logic

We prove that given two cut free nets of linear logic, by means of their relational interpretations one can: 1) first determine whether or not the net obtained by cutting the two nets is strongly normalizable 2) then (in case it is strongly normalizable) compute the maximal length of the reduction sequences starting from that net.
