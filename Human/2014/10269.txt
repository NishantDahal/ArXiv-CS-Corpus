Proceedings Fifth International Workshop on Classical Logic and Computation

Classical Logic and Computation (CL&C) 2014 is the fifth edition of this workshop series. The workshop series intends to cover all work aiming to explore computational aspects of classical logic and mathematics. Its focus is on the exploration of the computational content of mathematical and logical principles, aiming to bring together researchers from both fields and exchange ideas. In this fifth edition we received 18 submissions of both short and full papers. Fourteen (14) of these were selected to present at the meeting in Vienna, and six (6) full papers were accepted to appear at this ETPCS special volume. Topics covered by this years submissions included: translations of classical to intuitionistic proofs, witness extraction from classical proofs, confluence properties for classical systems, linear logic, constructive semantics for classical logic (game semantics, realizability), and the study of calculi based on classical logic (lambda-mu-calculus, continuation calculus).
