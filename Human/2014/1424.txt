Tools for dynamics simulation of robots: a survey based on user feedback

The number of tools for dynamics simulation has grown in the last years. It is necessary for the robotics community to have elements to ponder which of the available tools is the best for their research. As a complement to an objective and quantitative comparison, difficult to obtain since not all the tools are open-source, an element of evaluation is user feedback. With this goal in mind, we created an online survey about the use of dynamical simulation in robotics. This paper reports the analysis of the participants' answers and a descriptive information fiche for the most relevant tools. We believe this report will be helpful for roboticists to choose the best simulation tool for their researches.
