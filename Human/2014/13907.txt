Analysis of Average Travel Time for Stateless Opportunistic Routing Techniques

Wireless network applications, such as, searching, routing, self stabilization and query processing can be modeled as random walks on graphs. Stateless Opportunistic routing technique is a robust distributed routing technique based on random walk approach, where nodes transfer the packets to one of their direct neighbors uniformly, until the packets reach their destinations. Simplicity in execution, fault tolerance, low overhead and robustness to topology changes made it more suitable to wireless sensor networks scenarios. But the main disadvantage of stateless opportunistic routing is estimating and studying the effect of network parameters on the packet latency. In this work, we derived the analytical expressions for mean latency or average packet travel time for r-nearest neighbor cycle, r-nearest neighbor torus networks. Further, we derived the generalized expression for mean latency for m-dimensional r- nearest neighbor torus networks and studied the effect of number of nodes, nearest neighbors and network dimension on average packet travel time.
