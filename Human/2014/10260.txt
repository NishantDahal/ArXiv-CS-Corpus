When Can a Relay Reduce End-to-End Communication Delay?

The impact of relaying on the latency of communication in a relay channel is studied. Both decode-forward (DF) and amplify-forward (AF) are considered, and are compared with the point-to-point (P2P) scheme which does not use the relay. The question as to whether DF and AF can decrease the latency of communicating a number of bits with a given reliability requirement is addressed. Latency expressions for the three schemes are derived. Although both DF and AF use a block-transmission structure which sends the information over multiple transmission blocks, they can both achieve latencies lower that P2P. Conditions under which this occurs are obtained. Interestingly, these conditions are more strict when compared to the conditions under which DF and AF achieve higher information-theoretic rates than P2P.
