Compressed Spaced Suffix Arrays

Spaced seeds are important tools for similarity search in bioinformatics, and using several seeds together often significantly improves their performance. With existing approaches, however, for each seed we keep a separate linear-size data structure, either a hash table or a spaced suffix array (SSA). In this paper we show how to compress SSAs relative to normal suffix arrays (SAs) and still support fast random access to them. We first prove a theoretical upper bound on the space needed to store an SSA when we already have the SA. We then present experiments indicating that our approach works even better in practice.
