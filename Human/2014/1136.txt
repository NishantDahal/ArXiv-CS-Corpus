Fault Tolerance of Small-World Regular and Stochastic Interconnection Networks

Resilience of the most important properties of stochastic and regular (deterministic) small-world interconnection networks is studied. It is shown that in the broad range of values of the fraction of faulty nodes the networks under consideration possess high fault tolerance, the deterministic networks being slightly better than the stochastic ones.
