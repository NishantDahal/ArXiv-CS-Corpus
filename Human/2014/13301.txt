On Gács' quantum algorithmic entropy

We define an infinite dimensional modification of lower-semicomputability of density operators by Gács with an attempt to fix some problem in the paper. Our attempt is partly achieved by showing the existence of universal operator under some additional assumption. It is left as a future task to eliminate this assumption. We also see some properties and examples which stimulate further research. In particular, we show that universal operator has certain nontrivial form if it exists.
