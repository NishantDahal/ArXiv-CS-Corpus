A note on diagonal and Hermitian surfaces

Aspects of the properties, enumeration and construction of points on diagonal and Hermitian surfaces have been considered extensively in the literature and are further considered here. The zeta function of diagonal surfaces is given as a direct result of the work of Wolfmann. Recursive construction techniques for the set of rational points of Hermitian surfaces are of interest. The relationship of these techniques here to the construction of codes on surfaces is briefly noted.
