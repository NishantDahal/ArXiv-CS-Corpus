Fingers' Angle Calculation using Level-Set Method

In the current age, use of natural communication in human computer interaction is a known and well installed thought. Hand gesture recognition and gesture based applications has gained a significant amount of popularity amongst people all over the world. It has a number of applications ranging from security to entertainment. These applications generally are real time applications and need fast, accurate communication with machines. On the other end, gesture based communications have few limitations also like bent finger information is not provided in vision based techniques. In this paper, a novel method for fingertip detection and for angle calculation of both hands bent fingers is discussed. Angle calculation has been done before with sensor based gloves/devices. This study has been conducted in the context of natural computing for calculating angles without using any wired equipment, colors, marker or any device. The pre-processing and segmentation of the region of interest is performed in a HSV color space and a binary format respectively. Fingertips are detected using level-set method and angles were calculated using geometrical analysis. This technique requires no training for system to perform the task.
