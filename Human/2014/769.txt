Hierarchies in inclusion logic with lax semantics

We study the expressive power of fragments of inclusion logic under the so-called lax team semantics. The fragments are defined either by restricting the number of universal quantifiers or the arity of inclusion atoms in formulae. In case of universal quantifiers, the corresponding hierarchy collapses at the first level. Arity hierarchy is shown to be strict by relating the question to the study of arity hierarchies in fixed point logics.
