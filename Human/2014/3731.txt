A Wireless System Using Random Residue Sequences

This paper describes the architecture of wireless communication system using random residue sequences. The basic scheme is that of spread spectrum but instead of using PN sequences for coding, we use random residue sequences. Such a system can provide cryptographic security whose strength would depend on the number of code sequences being used.
