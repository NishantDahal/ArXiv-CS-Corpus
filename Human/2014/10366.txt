A Body Area Network through Wireless Technology

A physiological signal monitoring system and alerting system using wireless technology is presented. The two types of physiological signal monitoring are captured from the body through leads and using the radio-frequency transmitting and receiving module the data are interfaced to computer systems. Furthering using a developed user interface module the captured signals are analyzed for checking abnormality. Any significant recordings are transmitted to the physicians hand phone by using external serial SMS modem. ECG signal de-noising is conducted by using low-pass and high-pass filters. EEG signals de-noising is conducted by using band-pass filters set. A comparative evaluation of the module with the manual recording shows encouraging results. The ECG and EEG pattern are presented in this paper.
