Proceedings 9th Workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic

This volume contains the proceedings of the ninth workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL2012) which took place in Brussels from the 10th to the 12th of October 2012.
  QPL2012 brought together researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and spatio-temporal causal structures.  The particular focus was on the use of logical tools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages, semantical techniques, and other computer science methods for the study of physical behaviour in general.
