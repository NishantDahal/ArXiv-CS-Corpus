On Quadratization of Pseudo-Boolean Functions

We survey current term-wise techniques for quadratizing high-degree pseudo-Boolean functions and introduce a new one, which allows multiple splits of terms. We also introduce the first aggregative approach, which splits a collection of terms based on their common parts.
