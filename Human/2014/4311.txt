Improved 3-Dimensional Security in Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a trending technology in the field of Information Technology as it allows sharing of resources over a network. The reason Cloud computing gained traction so rapidly was because of its performance, availability and low cost among other features. Besides these features, companies are still refraining from binding their business with cloud computing due to the fear of data leakage. The focus of this paper is on the problem of data leakage. It proposes a framework which works in two phases. The first phase consists of data encryption and classification which is performed before storing the data. In this phase, the client may want to encrypt his data prior to uploading. After encryption, data is classified using three parameters namely Confidentiality [C], Integrity [I] and Availability [A]. With the help of proposed algorithm, criticality rating (Cr) of the data is calculated. According to the Cr, security will be provided on the basis of the 3 Dimensions proposed in this paper. The second phase consists of data retrieval by the client. As per the concept of 3D, users who want to access their data need to be authenticated, to avoid data from being compromised. Before every access to data, the users identity is verified for authorization. After the user is authorized for data access, if the data is encrypted, the user can decrypt the same.
