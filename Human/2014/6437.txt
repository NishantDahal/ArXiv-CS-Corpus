Robust Outlier Detection Technique in Data Mining: A Univariate Approach

Outliers are the points which are different from or inconsistent with the rest of the data. They can be novel, new, abnormal, unusual or noisy information. Outliers are sometimes more interesting than the majority of the data. The main challenges of outlier detection with the increasing complexity, size and variety of datasets, are how to catch similar outliers as a group, and how to evaluate the outliers. This paper describes an approach which uses Univariate outlier detection as a pre-processing step to detect the outlier and then applies K-means algorithm hence to analyse the effects of the outliers on the cluster analysis of dataset.
