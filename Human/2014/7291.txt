Analysis of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC under low duty cycle

In this Letter, a discrete-time Markov Chain model is developed to study performance of IEEE 802.15.4 under low duty cycle. The performance is measured in terms of aggregate throughput and average power consumption per packet. The proposed analytical model is verified through ns2 simulations.
