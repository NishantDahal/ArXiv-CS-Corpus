Semantic-based Detection of Segment Outliers and Unusual Events for Wireless Sensor Networks

Environmental scientists have increasingly been deploying wireless sensor networks to capture valuable data that measures and records precise information about our environment. One of the major challenges associated with wireless sensor networks is the quality of the data and more specifically the detection of segment outliers and unusual events. Most previous research has focused on detecting outliers that are errors that are caused by unreliable sensors and sensor nodes. However, there is an urgent need for the development of new tools capable of identifying, tagging and visualizing erroneous segment outliers and unusual events from sensor data streams. In this paper, we present a SOUE Detector (Segment Outlier and Unusual Event-Detector) system for wireless sensor networks that combines statistical analyses using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) with domain expert knowledge (captured via an ontology and semantic inferencing rules). The resulting Web portal enables scientist to efficiently search across a collection of wireless sensor data streams and identify, retrieve and display segment outliers (both erroneous and genuine) within the data streams. In this paper, we firstly describe the detection algorithms, the implementation details and the functionality of the SOUE Detector system. Secondly we evaluate our approach using data that comprises sensor observations collected from a sensor network deployed in the Springbrook National Park in Queensland, Australia. The experimental results show that the SOUE-Detector can efficiently detect segment outliers and unusual events with high levels of precision and recall.
