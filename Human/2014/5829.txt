On the Outage Probability of the Full-Duplex Interference-Limited Relay Channel

In this paper, we study the performance, in terms of the asymptotic error probability, of a user which communicates with a destination with the aid of a full-duplex in-band relay. We consider that the network is interference-limited, and interfering users are distributed as a Poisson point process. In this case, the asymptotic error probability is upper bounded by the outage probability (OP). We investigate the outage behavior for well-known cooperative schemes, namely, decode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward (CF) considering fading and path loss. For DF we determine the exact OP and develop upper bounds which are tight in typical operating conditions. Also, we find the correlation coefficient between source and relay signals which minimizes the OP when the density of interferers is small. For CF, the achievable rates are determined by the spatial correlation of the interferences, and a straightforward analysis isn't possible. To handle this issue, we show the rate with correlated noises is at most one bit worse than with uncorrelated noises, and thus find an upper bound on the performance of CF. These results are useful to evaluate the performance and to optimize relaying schemes in the context of full-duplex wireless networks.
