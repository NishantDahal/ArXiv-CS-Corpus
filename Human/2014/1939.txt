Humanitarian Algorithms : A Codified Key Safety Switch Protocol for Lethal Autonomy

With the deployment of lethal autonomous weapons, there is the requirement that any such platform complies with the precepts of International Humanitarian Law. Humanitarian Algorithms[9: p. 9] ensure that lethal autonomous weapon systems perform military/security operations, within the confines of International Humanitarian Law. Unlike other existing techniques of regulating lethal autonomy this scheme advocates for an approach that enables Machine Learning. Lethal autonomous weapons must be equipped with appropriate fail-safe mechanisms that locks them if they malfunction.
