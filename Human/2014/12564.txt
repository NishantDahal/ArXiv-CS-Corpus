Future Communication Model for High-speed Railway Based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles

High-speed railway is playing an important role in mass transportation, due to its lower energy consumption, less environmental pollution, larger capacity and higher safety features. The development of high-speed railway makes people's life more and more convenient. Meanwhile, providing high quality of service broadband communications for fast-moving users still remains unsolved, despite the fact that new solutions of incremental improvements are keeping up with this unprecedented communication requirement growth. This article proposes a communication system infrastructure based on airborne relay for high-speed trains in the further Cyber-Physical Systems. Comparisons and feasibility analysis are provided as well as discussions of key wireless technologies and obstacles in this system.
