A Formal Approach to Distributed System Security Test Generation

Deployment of distributed systems sets high requirements for procedures for the security testing of these systems. This work introduces: (1) a list of typical threats based on standards and actual practices; (2) an extended six-layered model for test generation mission on the basis of technical specifications and end-user requirements. Based on the list of typical threats and the multilayer model, we describe a formal approach to the automated design and generation of security mechanisms checklists for complex distributed systems.
