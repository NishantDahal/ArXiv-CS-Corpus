Covering Rational Ruled Surfaces

We present an algorithm that covers any given rational ruled surface with two rational parametrizations. In addition, we present an algorithm that transforms any rational surface parametrization into a new rational surface parametrization without affine base points and such that the degree of the corresponding maps is preserved.
