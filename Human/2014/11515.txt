Fast Approximation and Randomized Algorithms for Diameter

We consider approximation of diameter of a set $S$ of $n$ points in dimension $m$. E$\tilde{g}$ecio$\tilde{g}$lu and Kalantari \cite{kal} have shown that given any $p \in S$, by computing its farthest in $S$, say $q$, and in turn the farthest point of $q$, say $q'$, we have ${\rm diam}(S) \leq \sqrt{3} d(q,q')$. Furthermore, iteratively replacing $p$ with an appropriately selected point on the line segment $pq$, in at most $t \leq n$ additional iterations, the constant bound factor is improved to $c_*=\sqrt{5-2\sqrt{3}} \approx 1.24$. Here we prove when $m=2$, $t=1$. This suggests in practice a few iterations may produce good solutions in any dimension. Here we also propose a randomized version and present large scale computational results with these algorithm for arbitrary $m$. The algorithms outperform many existing algorithms. On sets of data as large as $1,000,000$ points, the proposed algorithms compute solutions to within an absolute error of $10^{-4}$.
