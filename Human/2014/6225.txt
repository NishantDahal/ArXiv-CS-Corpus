An Efficient Read Dominant Data Replication Protocol under Serial Isolation using Quorum Consensus Approach

In distributed systems, data replication provides better availability, higher read capacity, improved access efficiency and lower bandwidth requirements in the system. In this paper, we propose a significantly efficient approach of the data replication for serial isolation by using newly proposed Circular quorum systems. This paper has three major contributions. First, we have proposed the Circular quorum systems that generalize the various existing quorum systems, such as Read-one-write-all (ROWA) quorum systems, Majority quorum systems, Grid quorum systems, Diamond quorum systems, D-Space quorum systems, Multi-dimensional-grid quorum systems and Generalized-grid quorum systems. Second, Circular quorum systems not only generalizes but also improves the performance over existing quorum systems of their category. Third, we proposed a highly available Circular quorum consensus protocol for data replication under serial isolation level that uses a suitable Circular quorum system for read dominant scenario.
