A Computational Study of Feasible Repackings in the FCC Incentive Auctions

We report the results of a computational study of repacking in the FCC Incentive Auctions. Our interest lies in the structure and constraints of the solution space of feasible repackings. Our analyses are "mechanism-free", in the sense that they identify constraints that must hold regardless of the reverse auction mechanism chosen or the prices offered for broadcaster clearing. We examine topics such as the amount of spectrum that can be cleared nationwide, the geographic distribution of broadcaster clearings required to reach a clearing target, and the likelihood of reaching clearing targets under various models for broadcaster participation. Our study uses FCC interference data and a satisfiability-checking approach, and elucidates both the unavoidable mathematical constraints on solutions imposed by interference, as well as additional constraints imposed by assumptions on the participation decisions of broadcasters.
