Deployment of an Innovative Resource Choice Method for Process Planning

Designers, process planners and manufacturers naturally consider different concepts for a same object. The stiffness of production means and the design specification requirements mark out process planners as responsible of the coherent integration of all constraints. First, this paper details an innovative solution of resource choice, applied for aircraft manufacturing parts. In a second part, key concepts are instanced for the considered industrial domain. Finally, a digital mock up validates the solution viability and demonstrates the possibility of an in-process knowledge capitalisation and use. Formalising the link between Design and Manufacturing allows to hope enhancements of simultaneous Product / Process developments.
