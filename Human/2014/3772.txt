FO(C) and Related Modelling Paradigms

Recently, C-Log was introduced as a language for modelling causal processes. Its formal semantics has been defined together with introductory examples, but the study of this language is far from finished. In this paper, we compare C-Log to other declarative modelling languages. More specifically, we compare to first-order logic (FO), and argue that C-Log and FO are orthogonal and that their integration, FO(C), is a knowledge representation language that allows for clear and succinct models. We compare FO(C) to E-disjunctive logic programming with the stable semantics, and define a fragment on which both semantics coincide. Furthermore, we discuss object-creation in FO(C), relating it to mathematics, business rules systems, and data base systems.
