PUC-Logic

We present a logic for Proximity-based Understanding of Conditionals (PUC-Logic) that unifies the Counterfactual and Deontic logics proposed by David Lewis. We also propose a natural deduction system (PUC-ND) associated to this new logic. This inference system is proven to be sound, complete, normalizing and decidable. The relative completeness for the $\boldsymbol{V}$ and $\boldsymbol{CO}$ logics is shown to emphasize the unified approach over the work of Lewis.
