Your data is your dogfood: DevOps in the astronomical observatory

DevOps is the contemporary term for a software development culture that purposefully blurs distinction between software development and IT operations by treating "infrastructure as code." DevOps teams typically implement practices summarised by the colloquial directive to "eat your own dogfood;" meaning that software tools developed by a team should be used internally rather thrown over the fence to operations or users. We present a brief overview of how DevOps techniques bring proven software engineering practices to IT operations. We then discuss the application of these practices to astronomical observatories.
