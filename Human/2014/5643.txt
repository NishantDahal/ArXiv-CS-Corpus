What kind of noise guarantees security for the Kirchhoff-Loop-Johnson-Noise key exchange?

This article is a supplement to our recent one about the analysis of the noise properties in the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) secure key exchange system [Gingl and Mingesz, PLOS ONE 9 (2014) e96109, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0096109]. Here we use purely mathematical statistical derivations to prove that only normal distribution with special scaling can guarantee security. Our results are in agreement with earlier physical assumptions [Kish, Phys. Lett. A 352 (2006) 178-182, doi: 10.1016/j.physleta.2005.11.062]. Furthermore, we have carried out numerical simulations to show that the communication is clearly unsecure for improper selection of the noise properties. Protection against attacks using time and correlation analysis is not considered in this paper.
