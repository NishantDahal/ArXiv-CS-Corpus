A Generalized Probabilistic Framework for Compact Codebook Creation

Compact and discriminative visual codebooks are preferred in many visual recognition tasks. In the literature, a number of works have taken the approach of hierarchically merging visual words of an initial large-sized codebook, but implemented this approach with different merging criteria. In this work, we propose a single probabilistic framework to unify these merging criteria, by identifying two key factors: the function used to model class-conditional distribution and the method used to estimate the distribution parameters. More importantly, by adopting new distribution functions and/or parameter estimation methods, our framework can readily produce a spectrum of novel merging criteria. Three of them are specifically focused in this work. In the first criterion, we adopt the multinomial distribution with Bayesian method; In the second criterion, we integrate Gaussian distribution with maximum likelihood parameter estimation. In the third criterion, which shows the best merging performance, we propose a max-margin-based parameter estimation method and apply it with multinomial distribution. Extensive experimental study is conducted to systematically analyse the performance of the above three criteria and compare them with existing ones. As demonstrated, the best criterion obtained in our framework achieves the overall best merging performance among the comparable merging criteria developed in the literature.
