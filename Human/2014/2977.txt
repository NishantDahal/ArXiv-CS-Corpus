Fulfillment Request Management (The approach)

In this paper we introduce the term FRM (Fulfillment Request Management). According to the FRM in a BSS / OSS environment we can use a unified approach to implement a SOA in order to integrate BSS with OSS and handle 1. Orders 2. Events 3. Processes. So in a way that systems like ESB, Order Management, and Business Process Management can be implemented under a unified architecture and a unified implementation. We assume that all the above mentioned are 'requests' and according to the system we want to implement, the request can be an event, an order, a process etc. So instead of having N systems we have 1 system that covers all the above (ESB, Order Management, BPM etc) With the FRM we can have certain advantages such as: 1. adaptation 2. Interoperability. 3. Re-usability 4. Fast implementation 5. Easy reporting. In this paper we present a set of the main principles in order to build an FRM System.
