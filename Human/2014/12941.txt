Im2Fit: Fast 3D Model Fitting and Anthropometrics using Single Consumer Depth Camera and Synthetic Data

Recent advances in consumer depth sensors have created many opportunities for human body measurement and modeling. Estimation of 3D body shape is particularly useful for fashion e-commerce applications such as virtual try-on or fit personalization. In this paper, we propose a method for capturing accurate human body shape and anthropometrics from a single consumer grade depth sensor. We first generate a large dataset of synthetic 3D human body models using real-world body size distributions. Next, we estimate key body measurements from a single monocular depth image. We combine body measurement estimates with local geometry features around key joint positions to form a robust multi-dimensional feature vector. This allows us to conduct a fast nearest-neighbor search to every sample in the dataset and return the closest one. Compared to existing methods, our approach is able to predict accurate full body parameters from a partial view using measurement parameters learned from the synthetic dataset. Furthermore, our system is capable of generating 3D human mesh models in real-time, which is significantly faster than methods which attempt to model shape and pose deformations. To validate the efficiency and applicability of our system, we collected a dataset that contains frontal and back scans of 83 clothed people with ground truth height and weight. Experiments on real-world dataset show that the proposed method can achieve real-time performance with competing results achieving an average error of 1.9 cm in estimated measurements.
