Elicitation and Modeling Non-Functional Requirements - A POS Case Study

Proper management of requirements is crucial to successful development software within limited time and cost. Nonfunctional requirements (NFR) are one of the key criteria to derive a comparison among various software systems. In most of software development NFR have be specified as an additional requirement of software. NFRs such as performance, reliability, maintainability, security, accuracy etc. have to be considered at the early stage of software development as functional requirement (FR). However, identifying NFR is not an easy task. Although there are well developed techniques for eliciting functional requirement, there is a lack of elicitation mechanism for NFR and there is no proper consensus regarding NFR elicitation techniques. Eliciting NFRs are considered to be one of the challenging jobs in requirement analysis. This paper proposes a UML use case based questionary approach to identifying and classifying NFR of a system. The proposed approach is illustrated by using a Point of Sale (POS) case study
