Enhancing SfePy with Isogeometric Analysis

In the paper a recent enhancement to the open source package SfePy (Simple Finite Elements in Python, http://sfepy.org) is introduced, namely the addition of another numerical discretization scheme, the isogeometric analysis, to the original implementation based on the nowadays standard and well-established numerical solution technique, the finite element method. The isogeometric removes the need of the solution domain approximation by a piece-wise polygonal domain covered by the finite element mesh, and allows approximation of unknown fields with a higher smoothness then the finite element method, which can be advantageous in many applications. Basic numerical examples illustrating the implementation and use of the isogeometric analysis in SfePy are shown.
