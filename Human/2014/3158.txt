Multi-view Face Analysis Based on Gabor Features

Facial analysis has attracted much attention in the technology for human-machine interface. Different methods of classification based on sparse representation and Gabor kernels have been widely applied in the fields of facial analysis. However, most of these methods treat face from a whole view standpoint. In terms of the importance of different facial views, in this paper, we present multi-view face analysis based on sparse representation and Gabor wavelet coefficients. To evaluate the performance, we conduct face analysis experiments including face recognition (FR) and face expression recognition (FER) on JAFFE database. Experiments are conducted from two parts: (1) Face images are divided into three facial parts which are forehead, eye and mouth. (2) Face images are divided into 8 parts by the orientation of Gabor kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can significantly boost the performance and perform better than the other methods.
