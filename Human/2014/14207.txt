Wireless Charger Networking for Mobile Devices: Fundamentals, Standards, and Applications

Wireless charging is a technique of transmitting power through an air gap to an electrical device for the purpose of energy replenishment. Recently, the wireless charging technology has been significantly advanced in terms of efficiency and functionality. This article first presents an overview and fundamentals of wireless charging. We then provide the review of standards, i.e., Qi and Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP), and highlight on their communication protocols. Next, we propose a novel concept of wireless charger networking which allows chargers to be connected to facilitate information collection and control. We demonstrate the application of the wireless charger network in user-charger assignment, which clearly shows the benefit in terms of reduced cost for users to identify the best chargers to replenish energy for their mobile devices.
