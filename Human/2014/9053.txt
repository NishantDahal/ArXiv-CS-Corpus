Trace representation of pseudorandom binary sequences derived from Euler quotients

We give the trace representation of a family of binary sequences derived from Euler quotients by determining the corresponding defining polynomials. Trace representation can help us producing the sequences efficiently and analyzing their cryptographic properties, such as linear complexity.
