Propositional dynamic logic for searching games with errors

We investigate some finitely-valued generalizations of propositional dynamic logic with tests. We start by introducing the (n+1)-valued Kripke models and a corresponding language based on a modal extension of Łukasiewicz many-valued logic. We illustrate the definitions by providing a framework for an analysis of the Rényi - Ulam searching game with errors.
  Our main result is the axiomatization of the theory of the (n+1)-valued Kripke models. This result is obtained through filtration of the canonical model of the smallest (n+1)-valued propositional dynamic logic.
