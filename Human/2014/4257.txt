Securing Virtualized Datacenters

Virtualization is a very popular solution to many problems in datacenter management. It offers increased utilization of existing system resources through effective consolidation, negating the need for more servers and additional rack space. Furthermore, it offers essential capabilities in terms of disaster recovery and potential savings on energy and maintenance costs. However, these benefits may be tempered by the increased complexities of securing virtual infrastructure. Do the benefits of virtualization outweigh the risks? In this study, the authors evaluated the functionalities of the basic components of virtual datacenters, identified the major risks to the data infrastructure, and present here several solutions for overcoming potential threats to virtual infrastructure.
