Conceptual Framework for Internet of Things' Virtualization via OpenFlow in Context-aware Networks

A novel conceptual framework is presented in this paper with an aim to standardize and virtualize Internet of Things(IoT) infrastructure through deploying OpenFlow technology. The framework can receivee services based on context information leaving the current infrastructure unchanged. This framework allows the active collaboration of heterogeneous devices and protocols. Moreover it is capable to model placement of physical objects, manage the system and to collect information for services deployed on an IoT infrastructure. Our proposed IoT virtualization is applicable to a random topology scenario which makes it possible to 1) share flow sensors resources 2) establish multioperational sensor networks, and 3) extend reachability within the framework without establishing any further physical networks. Flow sensors achieve better results comparable to the typical sensors with respect to packet generation, reachability, simulation time, throughput, energy consumption point of view. Even better results are possible through utilizing multicast groups in large scale networks.
