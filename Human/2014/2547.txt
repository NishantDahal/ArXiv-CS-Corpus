Better Performance ACF Operation for PAPR Reduction of OFDM Signal

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising modulation radio access scheme for next generation wireless communication systems because of its inherent immunity to multipath interference due to a low symbol rate, the use of a cyclic prefix, and its affinity to different transmission bandwidth arrangements. OFDM has already been adopted as a radio access scheme for several of the latest cellular system specifications such as the long-term evolution (LTE) system in the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project). Nevertheless, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of OFDM signal is a significant drawback since it restricts the efficiency of the transmitter. A number of promising approaches have been proposed & implemented to reduce PAPR with the expense of increase transmit signal power, bit error rate (BER) & computational complexity and data rate loss, etc. In this paper, a relatively better scheme of amplitude clipping & filtering operation (ACF) is proposed and implemented which shows the significant improvement in case of PAPR reduction while increasing slight BER compare to an present method.
