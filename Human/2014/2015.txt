Performance of Hull-Detection Algorithms For Proton Computed Tomography Reconstruction

Proton computed tomography (pCT) is a novel imaging modality developed for patients receiving proton radiation therapy. The purpose of this work was to investigate hull-detection algorithms used for preconditioning of the large and sparse linear system of equations that needs to be solved for pCT image reconstruction. The hull-detection algorithms investigated here included silhouette/space carving (SC), modified silhouette/space carving (MSC), and space modeling (SM). Each was compared to the cone-beam version of filtered backprojection (FBP) used for hull-detection. Data for testing these algorithms included simulated data sets of a digital head phantom and an experimental data set of a pediatric head phantom obtained with a pCT scanner prototype at Loma Linda University Medical Center. SC was the fastest algorithm, exceeding the speed of FBP by more than 100 times. FBP was most sensitive to the presence of noise. Ongoing work will focus on optimizing threshold parameters in order to define a fast and efficient method for hull-detection in pCT image reconstruction.
