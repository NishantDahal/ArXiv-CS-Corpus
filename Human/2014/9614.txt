Coding 35GB of Data in 35 Pages of Numbers

Usual information theoretical results show a logarithmic coding factor of value spaces to digital binary spaces using p-adic numbering systems. The following paper discusses a less commonly used case. It applies the same results to the difference space of bijective mappings of n-dimensional spaces to the line. It discusses a method where the logarithmic coding factor is provided over the Hamming radius of the code. An example is provided using the 35GB data dump of the Wikipedia website. This technique was initially developed for the study and computation of large permutation matrices on small clusters.
