Aca 2.0: Questions and Answers

"Academia 2.0" is a proposal to organize scientific publishing around true peer-to-peer distributed dissemination channels and eliminate the traditional role of the academic publisher. This model will be first presented at the 2014 workshop on Reproducible Research Methodologies and New Publication Models in Computer Engineering (TRUST'14) in the form of a high-level overview, so as to stimulate discussion and gather feedback on its merits and feasibility. This report complements the 6-page introductory article presented at TRUST, by detailing the review processes, some use scenarios and answering the reviewer's comments in detail.
