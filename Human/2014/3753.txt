NNexus Reloaded

Interlinking knowledge is one of the cornerstones of online collaboration. While wiki systems typically rely on links supplied by authors, in the early 2000s the mathematics encyclopedia at PlanetMath.org introduced a feature that provides automatic linking for previously defined concepts.

In this paper, we describe our recent reimplementation and revisioning of the NNexus system.
