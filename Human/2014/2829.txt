A Compressive Sensing Based Approach to Sparse Wideband Array Design

Sparse wideband sensor array design for sensor location optimisation is highly nonlinear and it is traditionally solved by genetic algorithms, simulated annealing or other similar optimization methods. However, this is an extremely time-consuming process and more efficient solutions are needed. In this work, this problem is studied from the viewpoint of compressive sensing and a formulation based on a modified $l_1$ norm is derived. As there are multiple coefficients associated with each sensor, the key is to make sure that these coefficients are simultaneously minimized in order to discard the corresponding sensor locations. Design examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
