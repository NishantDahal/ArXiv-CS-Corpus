A survey on Human Computer Interaction Mechanism Using Finger Tracking

Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field in which developer makes a user friendly system. User can interact with a computer system without using any conventional peripheral devices. Marker is used to recognize hand movement accurately & successfully. Researchers establish the mechanism to interact with computer system using computer vision. The interaction is better than normal static keyboard and mouse. This paper represents most of innovative mechanisms of the finger tracking used to interact with a computer system using computer vision.
