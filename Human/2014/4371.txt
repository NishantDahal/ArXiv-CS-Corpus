3D Vertical Dual-Layer Oxide Memristive Devices for Neuromorphic Computing

Dual-layer resistive switching devices with horizontal W electrodes, vertical Pd electrodes and WOx switching layer formed at the sidewall of the horizontal electrodes have been fabricated and characterized. The devices exhibit well-characterized analog switching characteristics and small mismatch in electrical characteristics for devices formed at the two layers. The three-dimensional (3D) vertical device structure allows higher storage density and larger connectivity for neuromorphic computing applications. We show the vertical devices exhibit potentiation and depression characteristics similar to planar devices, and can be programmed independently with no crosstalk between the layers.
