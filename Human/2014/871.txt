Guessing games

In a guessing game, players guess the value of a random real number selected using some probability density function. The winner may be determined in various ways; for example, a winner can be a player whose guess is closest in magnitude to the target or a winner can be a player coming closest without guessing higher than the target. We study optimal strategies for players in these games and determine some of them for two, three, and four players.
