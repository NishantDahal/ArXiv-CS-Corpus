Proceedings 15th International Workshop on Verification of Infinite-State Systems

This volume contains the proceedings of Infinity'13, the 15th International Workshop on Verification of Infinite-State Systems, which was held in Hanoi, Vietnam on the 14th of October 2013 as a satellite event of ATVA'13. The aim of the INFINITY workshop is to provide a forum for researchers interested in the development of formal methods and algorithmic techniques for the analysis of systems with infinitely many states, and their application in automated verification of complex software and hardware systems.
