Optimal Control of Applications for Hybrid Cloud Services

Development of cloud computing enables to move Big Data in the hybrid cloud services. This requires research of all processing systems and data structures for provide QoS. Due to the fact that there are many bottlenecks requires monitoring and control system when performing a query. The models and optimization criteria for the design of systems in a hybrid cloud infrastructures are created. In this article suggested approaches and the results of this build.
