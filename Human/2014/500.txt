A quadratically tight partition bound for classical communication complexity and query complexity

In this work we introduce, both for classical communication complexity and query complexity, a modification of the 'partition bound' introduced by Jain and Klauck [2010]. We call it the 'public-coin partition bound'. We show that (the logarithm to the base two of) its communication complexity and query complexity versions form, for all relations, a quadratically tight lower bound on the public-coin randomized communication complexity and randomized query complexity respectively.
