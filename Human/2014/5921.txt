Constructing Fewer Open Cells by GCD Computation in CAD Projection

A new projection operator based on cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is proposed. The new operator computes the intersection of projection factor sets produced by different CAD projection orders. In other words, it computes the gcd of projection polynomials in the same variables produced by different CAD projection orders. We prove that the new operator still guarantees obtaining at least one sample point from every connected component of the highest dimension, and therefore, can be used for testing semi-definiteness of polynomials. Although the complexity of the new method is still doubly exponential, in many cases, the new operator does produce smaller projection factor sets and fewer open cells. Some examples of testing semi-definiteness of polynomials, which are difficult to be solved by existing tools, have been worked out efficiently by our program based on the new method.
