Analysis of Topology Based Routing Protocols for Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET)

Now-a-days vehicles are one of the most important parts of our life. We need them to cross distances in our everyday life. In this paper we discuss Vehicular AdHoc Network (VANET) technology that can ensure the maintenance of traffic rules and regulation. By applying this technology we can save life, save time, corruption, vehicle security, avoid collision and so on. Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is a part of Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET). Every node or vehicle can move freely and they will communicate each other by wireless technology in coverage. The main goal of this research is to study the existing routing protocols for ad-hoc network system and compared between AODV (Reactive) and DSDV (Proactive). We have studied different types of routing protocols such as topology based, position based, cluster based, geo-cast based and broadcast based. We have simulated and compared AODV (Reactive) and DSDV (Proactive) to find out their efficiency and detect their flaws.
