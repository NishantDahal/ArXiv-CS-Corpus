Temporal Image Fusion

This paper introduces temporal image fusion. The proposed technique builds upon previous research in exposure fusion and expands it to deal with the limited Temporal Dynamic Range of existing sensors and camera technologies. In particular, temporal image fusion enables the rendering of long-exposure effects on full frame-rate video, as well as the generation of arbitrarily long exposures from a sequence of images of the same scene taken over time. We explore the problem of temporal under-exposure, and show how it can be addressed by selectively enhancing dynamic structure. Finally, we show that the use of temporal image fusion together with content-selective image filters can produce a range of striking visual effects on a given input sequence.
