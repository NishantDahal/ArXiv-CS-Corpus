Distance energy based routing algorithm with priority handling for UWSN

Under Water Sensor Networks (UWSN) have different characteristics than terrestrial sensor networks, so routing protocols developed for terrestrial networks are not suitable for UWSN. Underwater routing is comprehended by the underlying network architecture and design of sensor nodes. Therefore, efficient routing protocols need to be developed for UWSNs. We present a Routing scheme based on routing factor (Rf) which is a function of distance and residual energy. We also define Energy Scale Value to rationalize the available energy to take heterogeneity in energies into account. The algorithm routes a packet from one node to another by computing Rf for each neighboring node and selecting the node with minimum Rf as forwarding node, thereby providing an energy balancing mechanism among a set of candidate forwarding nodes. We have also included priority packets in our algorithm which are forwarded in a way so as to reduce the end to end delays between the packets and at respective nodes. Simulations of our proposed routing algorithm shows improvement in terms of network lifetime and number of packets delivered. Our simulations show improvement in lifetime by a factor of 2 when analyzed with Sector Based Routing(SBR-DLP).
