Distributions of Upper PAPR and Lower PAPR of OFDM Signals in Visible Light Communications

Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in visible light communications (VLC) inherits the disadvantage of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) from OFDM in radio frequency (RF) communications. The upper peak power and lower peak power of real-valued VLC-OFDM signals are both limited by the dynamic constraints of light emitting diodes (LEDs). The efficiency and transmitted electrical power are directly related with the upper PAPR (UPAPR) and lower PAPR (LPAPR) of VLC-OFDM. In this paper, we will derive the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of UPAPR and LPAPR, and investigate the joint distribution of UPAPR and LPAPR.
