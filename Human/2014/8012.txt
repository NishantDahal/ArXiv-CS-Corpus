Performance Analysis of VOIP Traffic Over Integrating Wireless LAN and WAN Using Different Codecs

A simulation model is presented to analyze and evaluate the performance of VoIP based integrated wireless LAN/WAN with taking into account various voice encoding schemes. The network model was simulated using OPNET Modeler software. Different parameters that indicate the QoS like MOS, jitter, end to end delay, traffic send and traffic received are calculated and analyzed in Wireless LAN/WAN scenarios. Depending on this evaluation, Selection codecs G.729A consider the best choice for VoIP.
