From Co- Toward Multi-Simulation of Smart Grids based on HLA and FMI Standards

In this article, a multi-simulation model is proposed to measure the performance of all Smart Grid perspectives as defined in the IEEE P2030 standard. As a preliminary implementation, a novel information technology (IT) and communication multi-simulator is developed following an High Level Architecture (HLA). To illustrate the usefulness of such a multi-simulator, a case study of a distribution network operation application is presented using real-world topology configurations with realistic communication traffic based on IEC 61850. The multi-simulator allows to quantify, in terms of communication delay and system reliability, the impacts of aggregating all traffic on a low-capacity wireless link based on Digital Mobile Radio (DMR) when a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network failure occurs. The case study illustrates that such a multi-simulator can be used to experiment new smart grid mechanisms and verify their impacts on all smart grid perspectives in an automated manner. Even more importantly, multi-simulation can prevent problems before modifying/upgrading a smart grid and thus potentially reduce utility costs.
