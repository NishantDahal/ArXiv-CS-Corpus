A New System For Recording The Radiological Effective Doses For Patients Investigated by Imaging Methods

In this paper the project of an integrated system for radiation safety and security of the patients investigated by radiological imaging methods is presented. The new system is based on smart cards and Public Key Infrastructure. The new system allows radiation effective dose data storage and a more accurate reporting system.
