Study of Gesture Recognition methods and augmented reality

With the growing technology, we humans always need something that stands out from the other thing. Gestures are most desirable source to Communicate with the Machines. Human Computer Interaction finds its importance when it comes to working with the Human gestures to control the computer applications. Usually we control the applications using mouse, keyboard, laser pointers etc. but, with the recent advent in the technology it has even left behind their usage by introducing more efficient techniques to control applications. There are many Gesture Recognition techniques that have been implemented using image processing in the past.
  However recognizing the gestures in the noisy background has always been a difficult task to achieve. In the proposed system, we are going to use one such technique called Augmentation in Image processing to control Media Player. We will recognize Gestures using which we are going to control the operations on Media player. Augmentation usually is one step ahead when it comes to virtual reality. It has no restrictions on the background. Moreover it also does not rely on certain things like gloves, color pointers etc. for recognizing the gesture. This system mainly appeals to those users who always looks out for a better option that makes their interaction with computer more simpler or easier.
