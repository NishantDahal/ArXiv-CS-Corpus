Density Adaptive Parallel Clustering

In this paper we are going to introduce a new nearest neighbours based approach to clustering, and compare it with previous solutions; the resulting algorithm, which takes inspiration from both DBscan and minimum spanning tree approaches, is deterministic but proves simpler, faster and doesnt require to set in advance a value for k, the number of clusters.
