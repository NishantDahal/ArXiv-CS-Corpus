Design and Realization of an S-Band Microwave Low-Noise Amplifier for Wireless RF Subsystems

This study undertakes the theoretical design, CAD modeling, realization, and performance analysis of a microwave low-noise amplifier (LNA) which has been accurately developed for operation at 3.0 GHz (S-band). The objective of this research is to thoroughly analyze and develop a reliable microstrip LNA intended for a potential employment in wireless communication systems, and satellite applications. The S-band microwave LNA demonstrates the appropriateness to develop a high-performance and well-established device realization for wireless RF systems. The microwave amplifier simulations have been conducted using the latest version of the AWR Design Environment software.
