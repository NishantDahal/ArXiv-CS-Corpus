Formalisation and Analysis of Component Dependencies

This set of theories presents a formalisation in Isabelle/HOL+Isar of data dependencies between components. The approach allows to analyse system structure oriented towards efficient checking of system: it aims at elaborating for a concrete system, which parts of the system (or system model) are necessary to check a given property.
