Spatially correlated channel estimation based on block iterative support detection for large-scale MIMO

Downlink channel estimation with low pilot overhead is an important and challenging problem in large-scale MIMO systems due to the substantially increased MIMO channel dimension. In this letter, we propose a block iterative support detection (block-ISD) based algorithm for downlink channel estimation to reduce the pilot overhead, which is achieved by fully exploiting the block sparsity inherent in the block-sparse equivalent channel derived from the spatial correlations of MIMO channels. Furthermore, unlike conventional compressive sensing (CS) algorithms that rely on prior knowledge of the sparsity level, block-ISD relaxes this demanding requirement and is thus more practically appealing. Simulation results demonstrate that block-ISD yields better normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance than classical CS algorithms, and achieve a reduction of 84% pilot overhead than conventional channel estimation techniques.
