Contribution à la modélisation explicite des plates-formes d'exécution pour l'IDM

One foundation of the model driven engineering (MDE) is to separate the modelling application description from its technological implementation (i.e. platform). Some of them are dedicated to the system execution. Hence, one promise solution of the MDE is to automate transformations from platform independent models to platform specific models. Little work has explicitly described platform characteristics. Yet, an explicit modelling allows taking in account their characteristics more easily (par ex., performances, maintainability,portability). This paper presents both an execution platform modelling state of art and a pattern to describe execution platform modelling framework. It intends to confirm the feasibility and the interests in describing an execution platform metamodel.
