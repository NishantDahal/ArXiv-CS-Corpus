Deconstruction of compound objects from image sets

We propose a method to recover the structure of a compound object from multiple silhouettes. Structure is expressed as a collection of 3D primitives chosen from a pre-defined library, each with an associated pose. This has several advantages over a volume or mesh representation both for estimation and the utility of the recovered model. The main challenge in recovering such a model is the combinatorial number of possible arrangements of parts. We address this issue by exploiting the sparse nature of the problem, and show that our method scales to objects constructed from large libraries of parts.
