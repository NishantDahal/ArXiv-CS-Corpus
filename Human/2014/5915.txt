Timed-Release Secret Sharing Scheme with Information Theoretic Security

In modern cryptography, the secret sharing scheme is an important cryptographic primitive and it is used in various situations. In this paper, a timed-release secret sharing scheme (TR-SS) with information-theoretic security is first studied. TR-SS is a secret sharing scheme with the property that participants more than a threshold number can reconstruct a secret by using their shares only when the time specified by a dealer has come. Specifically, in this paper we first introduce a model and formalization of security for TR-SS based on the traditional secret sharing scheme and information-theoretic timed-release security. We also derive tight lower bounds on the sizes of shares, time-signals, and entities' secret-keys required for TR-SS. In addition, we propose a direct construction for TR-SS. Our direct construction is optimal in the sense that the construction meets equality in each of our bounds. As a result, it is shown that the timed-release security can be realized without any additional redundancy on the share-size.
