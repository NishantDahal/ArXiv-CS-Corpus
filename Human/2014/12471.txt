A Polynomial Time Algorithm for Deciding Branching Bisimilarity on Totally Normed BPA

Strong bisimilarity on normed BPA is polynomial-time decidable, while weak bisimilarity on totally normed BPA is NP-hard. It is natural to ask where the computational complexity of branching bisimilarity on totally normed BPA lies. This paper confirms that this problem is polynomial-time decidable. To our knowledge, in the presence of silent transitions, this is the first bisimilarity checking algorithm on infinite state systems which runs in polynomial time. This result spots an instance in which branching bisimilarity and weak bisimilarity are both decidable but lie in different complexity classes (unless NP=P), which is not known before.
  The algorithm takes the partition refinement approach and the final implementation can be thought of as a generalization of the previous algorithm of Czerwi≈Ñski and Lasota. However, unexpectedly, the correctness of the algorithm cannot be directly generalized from previous works, and the correctness proof turns out to be subtle. The proof depends on the existence of a carefully defined refinement operation fitted for our algorithm and the proposal of elaborately developed techniques, which are quite different from previous works.
