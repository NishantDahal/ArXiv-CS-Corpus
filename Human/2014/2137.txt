LWRP: Low Power Consumption Weighting Replacement Policy using Buffer Memory

As the performance gap between memory and processors has increased, then it leads to the poor performance. Efficient virtual memory can overcome this problem. And the efficiency of virtual memory depends on the replacement policy used for cache. In this paper, our algorithm not only based on the time to last access and frequency index but, we also consider the power consumption. We show that Low Power Consumption Weighting Replacement Policy (LWRP) has better performance and low power consumption.
