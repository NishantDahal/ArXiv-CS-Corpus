Capturing Evidence From Wireless Internet Services Development

The merging of the Internet with the Wireless services domain has created a potential market whose characteristics are new technologies and time-to-market pressure. The lack of knowledge about new technologies and the need to be competitive in a short time demand that software organizations learn quickly about this domain and its characteristics. Additionally, the effects of development techniques in this context need to be understood. Learning from previous experiences in such a changing environment demands a clear understanding of the evidence to be captured, and how it could be used in the future. This article presents definitions of quantitative and qualitative evidence, and templates for capturing such evidence in a systematic way. Such templates were used in the context of two pilot projects dealing with the development of Wireless Internet Services.
