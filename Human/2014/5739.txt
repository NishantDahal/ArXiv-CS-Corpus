Peer-to-Peer Network Simulators: an Analytical Review

Simulators are the most dominant and eminent tool for analyzing and investigating different type of networks. The simulations can be executed with less cost as compared to large scale experiment as less computational resources are required and if the simulation model is carefully designed then it can be more practical than any well brought-up mathematical model. Generally P2P research is based on the principle of simulate first and then experiment in the real world and there is no reason that simulation results cannot be reproducible. A lack of standard documentation makes verification of results harder as well as due to such poor documentation implementation of well-known overlay algorithms was very difficult. This Paper describes different types of existing P2P simulators as well as provides a survey and comparison of existing P2P simulators and extracting the best simulator among them.
