Metamorphosis of Fuzzy Regular Expressions to Fuzzy Automata using the Follow Automata

To deal with system uncertainty, finite automata have been generalized into fuzzy automata. Stamenkovic and Ciric proposed an approach using the position automata for the construction of fuzzy automata from fuzzy regular expressions. There exist multifarious methodologies for the construction of finite automata from regular expressions known as Thompson construction, Antimirov partial derivatives, Glushkov automata and follow automata etc. In this paper, we propose an approach for the conversion of fuzzy regular expressions into fuzzy automata using the concept of follow automata. The number of states of the obtained Fuzzy automata using the proposed approach is lesser than the extant approaches in the literature.
