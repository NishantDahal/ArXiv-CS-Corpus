Connecting Spiking Neurons to a Spiking Memristor Network Changes the Memristor Dynamics

Memristors have been suggested as neuromorphic computing elements. Spike-time dependent plasticity and the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the neuron have both been modelled effectively by memristor theory. The d.c. response of the memristor is a current spike. Based on these three facts we suggest that memristors are well-placed to interface directly with neurons. In this paper we show that connecting a spiking memristor network to spiking neuronal cells causes a change in the memristor network dynamics by: removing the memristor spikes, which we show is due to the effects of connection to aqueous medium; causing a change in current decay rate consistent with a change in memristor state; presenting more-linear $I-t$ dynamics; and increasing the memristor spiking rate, as a consequence of interaction with the spiking neurons. This demonstrates that neurons are capable of communicating directly with memristors, without the need for computer translation.
