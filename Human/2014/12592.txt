Prefrontal Cortex Motivated Cognitive Architecture for Multiple Robots

In this paper, we introduce a cerebral cortex inspired architecture for robots in which we have mapped hierarchical cortical representation of human brain to logic flow and decision making process. Our work focuses on the two major features of human cognitive process, viz. the perception action cycle and its hierarchical organization, and the decision making process. To prove the effectiveness of our proposed method, we incorporated this architecture in our robot which we named as Cognitive Insect Robot inspired by Brain Architecture (CIRBA). We have extended our research to the implementation of this cognitive architecture of CIRBA in multiple robots and have analyzed the level of cognition attained by them
