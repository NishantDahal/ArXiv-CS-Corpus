A class of hopping patterns with minimal collisions

In \cite{VTC} three metrics for hopping pattern performance evaluation is proposed: column period, maximal collision ratio, maximal continual collision number, a lower bound of maximal continual collision number is given also. In this paper we give a lower bound of maximal collision ratio, a class of hopping pattern whose both maximal collision ratio and maximal continual collision number fit the lower bounds is constructed also.
