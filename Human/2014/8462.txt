In-homogeneous Virus Spread in Networks

Our $N$-intertwined model (now called NIMFA) for virus spread in any network with $N$ nodes is extended to a full heterogeneous setting. The metastable steady-state nodal infection probabilities are specified in terms of a generalized Laplacian, that possesses analogous properties as the classical Laplacian in graph theory. The critical threshold that separates global network infection from global network health is characterized via an $N$ dimensional vector that makes the largest eigenvalue of a modified adjacency matrix equal to unity. Finally, the steady-state infection probability of node $i$ is convex in the own curing rate $δ_{i}$, but concave in the curing rates $δ_{j}$ of the other nodes $1\leq j\neq i\leq N$ in the network.
