MacWilliams Identities for $m$-tuple Weight Enumerators

Since MacWilliams proved the original identity relating the Hamming weight enumerator of a linear code to the weight enumerator of its dual code there have been many different generalizations, leading to the development of $m$-tuple support enumerators. We prove a generalization of theorems of Britz and of Ray-Chaudhuri and Siap, which build on earlier work of Kl√∏ve, Shiromoto, Wan, and others. We then give illustrations of these $m$-tuple weight enumerators.
