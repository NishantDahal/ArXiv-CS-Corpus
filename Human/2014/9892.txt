Scaling-Up Model-Based-Development for Large Heterogeneous Systems with Compositional Modeling

Model-based development and in particular MDA [1], [2] have promised to be especially suited for the development of complex, heterogeneous, and large software systems. However, so far MDA has failed to fulfill this promise to a larger extent because of tool support being inadequate and clumsy and methodologies not being appropriate for an effective development. This article discusses what went wrong in current MDA approaches and what needs to be done to make MDA suited for ultra-large, distributed systems.
