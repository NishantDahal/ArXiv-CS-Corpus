Polyceptron: A Polyhedral Learning Algorithm

In this paper we propose a new algorithm for learning polyhedral classifiers which we call as Polyceptron. It is a Perception like algorithm which updates the parameters only when the current classifier misclassifies any training data. We give both batch and online version of Polyceptron algorithm. Finally we give experimental results to show the effectiveness of our approach.
