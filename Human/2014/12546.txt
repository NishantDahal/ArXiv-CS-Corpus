Authentication Using Piggy Bank Approach to Secure Double-Lock Cryptography

The piggy bank idea allows one-way encryption of information that can be accessed only by authorized parties. Here we show how the piggy bank idea can be used to authenticate parties to counter man-in-the-middle (MIM) attack that can jeopardize the double-lock cryptography protocol. We call this method double-signature double lock cryptography and it can be implemented in ways that go beyond hash-based message authentication.
