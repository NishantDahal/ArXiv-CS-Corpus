Bringing Web Time Travel to MediaWiki: An Assessment of the Memento MediaWiki Extension

We have implemented the Memento MediaWiki Extension Version 2.0, which brings the Memento Protocol to MediaWiki, used by Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Foundation. Test results show that the extension has a negligible impact on performance. Two 302 status code datetime negotiation patterns, as defined by Memento, have been examined for the extension: Pattern 1.1, which requires 2 requests, versus Pattern 2.1, which requires 3 requests. Our test results and mathematical review find that, contrary to intuition, Pattern 2.1 performs better than Pattern 1.1 due to idiosyncrasies in MediaWiki. In addition to implementing Memento, Version 2.0 allows administrators to choose the optional 200-style datetime negotiation Pattern 1.2 instead of Pattern 2.1. It also permits administrators the ability to have the Memento MediaWiki Extension return full HTTP 400 and 500 status codes rather than using standard MediaWiki error pages. Finally, version 2.0 permits administrators to turn off recommended Memento headers if desired. Seeing as much of our work focuses on producing the correct revision of a wiki page in response to a user's datetime input, we also examine the problem of finding the correct revisions of the embedded resources, including images, stylesheets, and JavaScript; identifying the issues and discussing whether or not MediaWiki must be changed to support this functionality.
