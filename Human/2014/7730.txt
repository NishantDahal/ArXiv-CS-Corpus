Virus Detection in Multiplexed Nanowire Arrays using Hidden Semi-Markov models

In this paper, we address the problem of real-time detection of viruses docking to nanowires, especially when multiple viruses dock to the same nano-wire. The task becomes more complicated when there is an array of nanowires coated with different antibodies, where different viruses can dock to each coated nanowire at different binding strengths. We model the array response to a viral agent as a pattern of conductance change over nanowires with known modifier --- this representation permits analysis of the output of such an array via belief network (Bayes) methods, as well as novel generative models like the Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM).
