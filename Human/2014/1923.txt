Animation of 3D Human Model Using Markerless Motion Capture Applied To Sports

Markerless motion capture is an active research in 3D virtualization. In proposed work we presented a system for markerless motion capture for 3D human character animation, paper presents a survey on motion and skeleton tracking techniques which are developed or are under development. The paper proposed a method to transform the motion of a performer to a 3D human character (model), the 3D human character performs similar movements as that of a performer in real time. In the proposed work, human model data will be captured by Kinect camera, processed data will be applied on 3D human model for animation. 3D human model is created using open source software (MakeHuman). Anticipated dataset for sport activity is considered as input which can be applied to any HCI application.
