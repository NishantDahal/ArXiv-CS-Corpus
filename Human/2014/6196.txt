Collective intelligence in Massive Online Dialogues

The emergence and ongoing development of Web 2.0 technologies have enabled new and advanced forms of collective intelligence at unprecedented scales, allowing large numbers of individuals to act collectively and create high quality intellectual artifacts. However, little is known about how and when they indeed promote collective intelligence. In this manuscript, we provide a survey of the automated tools developed to analyze discourse-centric collective intelligence. By conducting a thematic analysis of the current research direction, a set of gaps and limitations are identified.
