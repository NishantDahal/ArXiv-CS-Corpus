Algebraic Properties of Stochastic Effectivity Functions

Effectivity functions are the basic formalism for investigating the semantics game logic. We discuss algebraic properties of stochastic effectivity functions, in particular the relationship to stochastic relations, morphisms and congruences are defined, and the relationship of abstract logical equivalence and behavioral equivalence is investigated.
