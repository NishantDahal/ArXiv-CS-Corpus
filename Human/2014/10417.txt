A Survey of Bandwidth Optimization Techniques and Patterns in VoIP Services and Applications

This article surveys the various techniques adopted for optimising bandwidth for VoIP services over the period 1999-2014. The improvement of bandwidth can be realized through; silence suppression measure of repressing the silent portions (packets) in a voice conversation using Voice Activity Detection algorithm; by so doing, the transmission rate during the inactive periods of speech is reduced, and thus, the mean transmission rate can be reduced. A second measure is packet header reduction which defines a process of multiplexing and de-multiplexing packet headers to curb excesses. Voice/ Packet Header compression is considered the most productive of all the techniques, offering a scheme where VoIP packets are compressed from the 40 bytes of size to a smaller byte size of 2 bytes. When combined with aggregation, compression potentially yields a compressed size of up to 1 byte. In either case, bandwidth save is reached using compression and decompression codecs of varying data and bit rates. It is envisaged that an improvement in the performance of codecs would yield a better result in terms of enhancing results favourably in Voice over broadband networks
