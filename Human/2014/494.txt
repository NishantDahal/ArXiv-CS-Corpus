Multidisciplinary Engineering Models: Methodology and Case Study in Spreadsheet Analytics

This paper demonstrates a methodology to help practitioners maximise the utility of complex multidisciplinary engineering models implemented as spreadsheets, an area presenting unique challenges. As motivation we investigate the expanding use of Integrated Resource Management(IRM) models which assess the sustainability of urban masterplan designs. IRM models reflect the inherent complexity of multidisciplinary sustainability analysis by integrating models from many disciplines. This complexity makes their use time-consuming and reduces their adoption.
  We present a methodology and toolkit for analysing multidisciplinary engineering models implemented as spreadsheets to alleviate such problems and increase their adoption. For a given output a relevant slice of the model is extracted, visualised and analysed by computing model and interdisciplinary metrics. A sensitivity analysis of the extracted model supports engineers in their optimisation efforts. These methods expose, manage and reduce model complexity and risk whilst giving practitioners insight into multidisciplinary model composition. We report application of the methodology to several generations of an industrial IRM model and detail the insight generated, particularly considering model evolution.
