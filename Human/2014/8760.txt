Validation of the development methodologies

This paper argues that modelling the development methodologies can improve the multi-agents systems software engineering. Such modelling allows applying methods, techniques and practices used in the software development to the methodologies themselves. The paper discusses then the advantages of the modelling of development methodologies. It describes a model of development methodologies, uses such a model to develop a system of their partial validation, and applies such a system to multi-agent methodologies. Several benefits can be gained from such modelling, such as the improvement of the works on the development, evaluation and comparison of multi-agent development methodologies.
