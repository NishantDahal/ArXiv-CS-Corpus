Complexity to Find Wiener Index of Some Graphs

The Wiener index is one of the oldest graph parameter which is used to study molecular-graph-based structure. This parameter was first proposed by Harold Wiener in 1947 to determining the boiling point of paraffin. The Wiener index of a molecular graph measures the compactness of the underlying molecule. This parameter is wide studied area for molecular chemistry. It is used to study the physio-chemical properties of the underlying organic compounds. The Wiener index of a connected graph is denoted by W(G) and is defined as, that is W(G) is the sum of distances between all pairs (ordered) of vertices of G. In this paper, we give the algorithmic idea to find the Wiener index of some graphs, like cactus graphs and intersection graphs, viz. interval, circular-arc, permutation, trapezoid graphs.
