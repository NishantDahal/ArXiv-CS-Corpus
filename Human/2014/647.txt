Power Aware Wireless File Downloading: A Constrained Restless Bandit Approach

This paper treats power-aware throughput maximization in a multi-user file downloading system. Each user can receive a new file only after its previous file is finished. The file state processes for each user act as coupled Markov chains that form a generalized restless bandit system. First, an optimal algorithm is derived for the case of one user. The algorithm maximizes throughput subject to an average power constraint. Next, the one-user algorithm is extended to a low complexity heuristic for the multi-user problem. The heuristic uses a simple online index policy and its effectiveness is shown via simulation. For simple 3-user cases where the optimal solution can be computed offline, the heuristic is shown to be near-optimal for a wide range of parameters.
