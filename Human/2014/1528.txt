Compound Multiple Access Channel with Confidential Messages

In this paper, we study the problem of secret communication over a Compound Multiple Access Channel (MAC). In this channel, we assume that one of the transmitted messages is confidential that is only decoded by its corresponding receiver and kept secret from the other receiver. For this proposed setting (compound MAC with confidential messages), we derive general inner and outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region. Also, as examples, we investigate 'Less noisy' and 'Gaussian' versions of this channel, and extend the results of the discrete memoryless version to these cases. Moreover, providing numerical examples for the Gaussian case, we illustrate the comparison between achievable rate regions of compound MAC and compound MAC with confidential messages.
