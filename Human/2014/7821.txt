Toward Network-based Keyword Extraction from Multitopic Web Documents

In this paper we analyse the selectivity measure calculated from the complex network in the task of the automatic keyword extraction. Texts, collected from different web sources (portals, forums), are represented as directed and weighted co-occurrence complex networks of words. Words are nodes and links are established between two nodes if they are directly co-occurring within the sentence. We test different centrality measures for ranking nodes - keyword candidates. The promising results are achieved using the selectivity measure. Then we propose an approach which enables extracting word pairs according to the values of the in/out selectivity and weight measures combined with filtering.
