Comparison Of Document Management Systems By Meta Modelling And Workforce Centric Tuning Measures

Document management software are used widely for office paper management and related workflows. However, they have some differences from a flexibility perspective for the needs of workers. Moreover, they also differentiate in their underlying conceptual design. In this paper, a set (eight) of widely used document management systems are chosen from internet reviews [5] [6] and their conceptual models are analysed with meta modeling and flexibility tuning measures. The main objective is to compare these systems by analyzing their human-orientation and flexibility. This analysis provides useful information for organizations especially looking for document management systems which are more workforce centric.
