Py-oopsi: the python implementation of the fast-oopsi algorithm

Fast-oopsi was developed by Joshua Vogelstein in 2009, which is now widely used to extract neuron spike activities from calcium fluorescence signals. Here, we propose detailed implementation of the fast-oopsi algorithm in python programming language. Some corrections are also made to the original fast-oopsi paper.
