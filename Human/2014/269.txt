Hierarchical pixel clustering for image segmentation

In the paper a piecewise constant image approximations of sequential number of pixel clusters or segments are treated. A majorizing of optimal approximation sequence by hierarchical sequence of image approximations is studied. Transition from pixel clustering to image segmentation by reducing of segment numbers in clusters is provided. Algorithms are proved by elementary formulas.
