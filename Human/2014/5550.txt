Analysis of S Band Substrate Integrated Waveguide Power Divider, Circulator and Coupler

The Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) technology is a very promising technique with which we can take the advantages of both waveguides and planar transmission lines. Therefore, in [2.1-3] GHz band various microwave components and devices have been designed successfully using Ansoft HFSS software. We then proceeded to the realization of the coupler and then made measurements of the frequency response in the range [2.1-3] GHz using a network analyzer. Thus, results of this modeling are presented, discussed and allow to integrate these devices in planar circuits.
