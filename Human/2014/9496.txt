Structure Analysis on the $k$-error Linear Complexity for $2^n$-periodic Binary Sequences

In this paper, in order to characterize the critical error linear complexity spectrum (CELCS) for $2^n$-periodic binary sequences, we first propose a decomposition based on the cube theory. Based on the proposed $k$-error cube decomposition, and the famous inclusion-exclusion principle, we obtain the complete characterization of $i$th descent point (critical point) of the k-error linear complexity for $i=2,3$. Second, by using the sieve method and Games-Chan algorithm, we characterize the second descent point (critical point) distribution of the $k$-error linear complexity for $2^n$-periodic binary sequences. As a consequence, we obtain the complete counting functions on the $k$-error linear complexity of $2^n$-periodic binary sequences as the second descent point for $k=3,4$. This is the first time for the second and the third descent points to be completely characterized. In fact, the proposed constructive approach has the potential to be used for constructing $2^n$-periodic binary sequences with the given linear complexity and $k$-error linear complexity (or CELCS), which is a challenging problem to be deserved for further investigation in future.
