ROMEO: ReputatiOn Model Enhancing OpenID Simulator

OpenID is a standard decentralized initiative aimed at allowing Internet users to use the same personal account to access different services. Since it does not rely on any central authority, it is hard for such users or other entities to validate the trust level of each entity deployed in the system. Some research has been conducted to handle this issue, defining a reputation framework to determine the trust level of a relying party based on past experiences. However, this framework has been proposed in a theoretical way and some deeper analysis and validation is still missing. Our main contribution in this paper consist of a simulation environment able to validate the feasibility of the reputation framework and analyze its behaviour within different scenarios.
