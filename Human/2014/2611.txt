DDoS Attack and Interception Resistance IP Fast Hopping Based Protocol

Denial-of-Service attacks continue to be a serious problem for the Internet community despite the fact that a large number of defense approaches has been proposed by the research community. In this paper we introduce IP Fast Hopping, easily deployable and effective network-layer architecture against DDoS attacks. Our approach also provides an easy way for clients to hide content and destination server of theirs communication sessions. We describe a method of dynamic server IP address change and all modules necessary to implement the approach.
