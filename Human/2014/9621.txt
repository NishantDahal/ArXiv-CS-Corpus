Ambiguity of ω-Languages of Turing Machines

An ω-language is a set of infinite words over a finite alphabet X. We consider the class of recursive ω-languages, i.e. the class of ω-languages accepted by Turing machines with a Büchi acceptance condition, which is also the class Σ11 of (effective) analytic subsets of Xω for some finite alphabet X. We investigate here the notion of ambiguity for recursive ω-languages with regard to acceptance by Büchi Turing machines. We first present in detail essentials on the literature on ω-languages accepted by Turing Machines. Then we give a complete and broad view on the notion of ambiguity and unambiguity of Büchi Turing machines and of the ω-languages they accept. To obtain our new results, we make use of results and methods of effective descriptive set theory.
