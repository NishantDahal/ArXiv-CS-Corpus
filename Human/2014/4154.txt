QoS group based optimal retransmission medium access protocol for wireless sensor networks

This paper presents, a Group Based Optimal Retransmission Medium Access (GORMA) Protocol is designed that combines protocol of Collision Avoidance (CA) and energy management for low-cost, short-range, low-data rate and low-energy sensor nodes applications in environment monitoring, agriculture, industrial plants etc. In this paper, the GORMA protocol focuses on efficient MAC protocol to provide autonomous Quality of Service (QoS) to the sensor nodes in one-hop QoS retransmission group and two QoS groups in WSNs where the source nodes do not have receiver circuits. Hence, they can only transmit data to a sink node, but cannot receive acknowledgement control signals from the sink node. The proposed protocol GORMA provides QoS to the nodes which work independently on predefined time by allowing them to transmit each packet an optimal number of times within a given period. Our simulation results shows that the performance of GORMA protocol, which maximize the delivery probability of one-hop QoS group and two QoS groups and minimize the energy consumption.
