Upgrade of A Robot Workstation for Positioning of Measuring Objects on CMM

In order to decrease the measuring cycle time on the coordinate measuring machine (CMM) a robot workstation for the positioning of measuring objects was created. The application of a simple 5-axis industrial robot enables the positioning of the objects within the working space of CMM and measuring of different surfaces on the same object without human intervention. In this article an upgrade of an existing robot workstation through different design measures is shown. The main goal of this upgrade is to improve the measuring accuracy of the complex robot-CMM system.
