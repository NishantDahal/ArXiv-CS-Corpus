Explicit Matrices with the Restricted Isometry Property: Breaking the Square-Root Bottleneck

Matrices with the restricted isometry property (RIP) are of particular interest in compressed sensing. To date, the best known RIP matrices are constructed using random processes, while explicit constructions are notorious for performing at the "square-root bottleneck," i.e., they only accept sparsity levels on the order of the square root of the number of measurements. The only known explicit matrix which surpasses this bottleneck was constructed by Bourgain, Dilworth, Ford, Konyagin and Kutzarova. This chapter provides three contributions to further the groundbreaking work of Bourgain et al.: (i) we develop an intuition for their matrix construction and underlying proof techniques; (ii) we prove a generalized version of their main result; and (iii) we apply this more general result to maximize the extent to which their matrix construction surpasses the square-root bottleneck.
