An OvS-MultiObjective Algorithm Approach for Lane Reversal Problem

The lane reversal has proven to be a useful method to mitigate traffic congestion during rush hour or in case of specific events that affect high traffic volumes. In this work we propose a methodology that is placed within optimization via Simulation, by means of which a multi-objective genetic algorithm and simulations of traffic are used to determine the configuration of ideal lane reversal.
