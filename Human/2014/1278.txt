A chaotic image encryption scheme owning temp-value feedback

This paper presents a novel efficient chaotic image encryption scheme, in which the temp-value feedback mechanism is introduced to the permutation and diffusion procedures. Firstly, a simple trick is played to map the plain-image pixels to the initial condition of the Logistic map. Then, a pseudorandom number sequence (PRNS) is obtained from iterating the map. The permutation procedure is carried out by a permutation sequence which is generated by comparing the PRNS and its sorted version. The diffusion procedure is composed of two reversely executed rounds. During each round, the current plain-image pixel and the last cipher-image pixel are used to produce the current cipher-image pixel with the help of the Logistic map and a pseudorandom number generated by the Chen system. To enhance the efficiency, only expanded XOR operation and modulo 256 addition are employed during diffusion. Experimental results show that the new scheme owns a large key space and can resist the differential attack. It is also efficient.
