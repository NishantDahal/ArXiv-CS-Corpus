Robust Video Watermarking Schemes in Phase domain Using Binary Phase Shift Keying

This paper presents a robust video watermarking scheme in Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Sequencyordered Complex Hadamard Transform (SCHT). The DFT and SCHT coefficients are complex and consist of both magnitude and phase and are well suited to adopt phase shift keying techniques to embed the watermark. In the proposed schemes, the phases of DFT and SCHT coefficients are modified to convey watermark information using binary phase shift keying in cover video. Low amplitude block selection (LABS) is used to improve transparency, amplitude boost to improve the resistance of watermark from signal processing and compression attacks and spread spectrum technique is used for encrypting watermark in order to protect it from third party. It is observed that both algorithms showing more or less same robustness but SCHT offers high transparency, simple implementation and less computational cost than DFT.
