Optimized Distributed Inter-cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) Scheme using Projected Subgradient and Network Flow Optimization

In this paper, we tackle the problem of multi-cell resource scheduling, where the objective is to maximize the weighted sum-rate through inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC). The blanking method is used to mitigate the inter-cell interference, where a resource is either used with a predetermined transmit power or not used at all, i.e., blanked. This problem is known to be strongly NP-hard, which means that it is not only hard to solve in polynomial time, but it is also hard to find an approximation algorithm with guaranteed optimality gap. In this work, we identify special scenarios where a polynomial-time algorithm can be constructed to solve this problem with theoretical guarantees. In particular, we define a dominant interference environment, in which for each user the received power from each interferer is significantly greater than the aggregate received power from all other weaker interferers.
  We show that the strongly NP-hard problem can be tightly relaxed to a linear programming problem in a dominant interference environment. Consequently, we propose a polynomial-time distributed algorithm that is based on the primal-decomposition, the projected-subgradient, and the network flow optimization methods. In comparison with baseline schemes, simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves higher gains in aggregate throughput, cell-edge throughput, and outage probability.
