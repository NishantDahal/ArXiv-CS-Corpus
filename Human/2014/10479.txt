Extended Delivery Time Analysis for Non-work-preserving Packet Transmission in Cognitive Environment

Cognitive radio transceiver can opportunistically access the underutilized spectrum resource of primary systems for new wireless services. With interweave cognitive implementation, the secondary transmission may be interrupted by the primary user's transmission. To facilitate the packet delay analysis of such secondary transmission, we study the resulting extended delivery time that includes both transmission time and waiting time. In particular, we derive the exact distribution function of extended delivery time of a fixed-size secondary packet with non-work-preserving strategy i.e. interrupted packets will be retransmitted. Both continuous sensing and periodic sensing with and without missed detection cases are considered. Selected numerical and simulation results are presented for verifying the mathematical formulation. Finally, we apply the results to secondary queuing analysis with a generalized M/G/1 queue set-up. The analytical results will greatly facilitate the design of the secondary system for particular target application.
