Efficient Key Generation for Dynamic Blom's Scheme

In this paper, we propose an efficient key management scheme by generating new public and private keys in the Blom scheme. We also focus on making this scheme dynamic by randomly changing the secret key that is generated by the base station and we propose the use of the mesh array for matrix multiplication for reducing the computation overhead.
