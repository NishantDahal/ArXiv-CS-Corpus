A Robust and Efficient Detection Algorithm for The Photon-Counting Free-Space Optical System

We propose a Viterbi-type trellis-search algorithm to implement the FSO photon-counting sequence receiver proposed in [1] more efficiently and a selective-store strategy to overcome the error floor problem observed therein.
