On the Complexity of Immersed Normal Surfaces

Normal surface theory, a tool to represent surfaces in a triangulated 3-manifold combinatorially, is ubiquitous in computational 3-manifold theory. In this paper, we investigate a relaxed notion of normal surfaces where we remove the quadrilateral conditions. This yields normal surfaces that are no longer embedded. We prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether such a surface is immersed. Our proof uses a reduction from Boolean constraint satisfaction problems where every variable appears in at most two clauses, using a classification theorem of Feder. We also investigate variants, and provide a polynomial-time algorithm to test for a local version of this problem.
