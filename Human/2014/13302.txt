Observational Equivalence Using Schedulers for Quantum Processes

In the study of quantum process algebras, researchers have introduced different notions of equivalence between quantum processes like bisimulation or barbed congruence. However, there are intuitively equivalent quantum processes that these notions do not regard as equivalent. In this paper, we introduce a notion of equivalence named observational equivalence into qCCS. Since quantum processes have both probabilistic and nondeterministic transitions, we introduce schedulers that solve nondeterministic choices and obtain probability distribution of quantum processes. By definition, the restrictions of schedulers change observational equivalence. We propose some definitions of schedulers, and investigate the relation between the restrictions of schedulers and observational equivalence.
