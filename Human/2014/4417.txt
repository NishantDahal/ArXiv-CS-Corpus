Efficient Decomposition of Bimatrix Games (Extended Abstract)

Exploiting the algebraic structure of the set of bimatrix games, a divide-and-conquer algorithm for finding Nash equilibria is proposed. The algorithm is fixed-parameter tractable with the size of the largest irreducible component of a game as parameter. An implementation of the algorithm is shown to yield a significant performance increase on inputs with small parameters.
