Gray Level Image Enhancement Using Polygonal Functions

This paper presents a method for enhancing the gray level images. This method takes part from the category of point transforms and it is based on interpolation functions. The latter have a graphic represented by polygonal lines. The interpolation nodes of these functions are calculated taking into account the statistics of gray levels belonging to the image.
