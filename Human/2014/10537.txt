An Interim Summary on Semantic Model Differencing

This position paper provides an interim summary on the goals and current state of our ongoing research project on semantic model differencing for software evolution. We describe the basics of semantic model differencing, give two examples from our recent work, and discuss future challenges in taking full advantage of the potential of semantic differencing techniques in the context of models' evolution.
