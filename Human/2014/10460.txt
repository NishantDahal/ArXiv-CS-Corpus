Evaluating the Electrification of Vehicle Fleets Using the Veins Framework

The case study discussed in this paper involves a company maintaining a vehicle fleet of one hundred vehicles. In this article we will discuss how we extend and deploy the Veins framework, which couples OMNeT++ and SUMO, to help in the process of electrifying this vehicle fleet, i.e., replacing combustion engine cars with electric vehicles to save money and lower CO$_2$ emissions.
