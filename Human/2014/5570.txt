SocRecM: A Scalable Social Recommender Engine for Online Marketplaces

In this paper, we present work-in-progress on SocRecM, a novel social recommendation framework for online marketplaces. We demonstrate that SocRecM is not only easy to integrate with existing Web technologies through a RESTful, scalable and easy-to-extend service-based architecture but also reveal the extent to which various social features and recommendation approaches are useful in an online social marketplace environment.
