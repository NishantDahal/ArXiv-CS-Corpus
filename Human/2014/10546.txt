A Mobile Food Recommendation System Based on The Traffic Light Diet

Innovative, real-time solutions are needed to address the mismatch between the demand for and supply of critical information to inform and motivate diet and health-related behavior change. Research suggests that interventions using mobile health technologies hold great promise for influencing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to energy balance. The objective of this paper is to present insights related to the development and testing of a mobile food recommendation system targeting fast food restaurants. The system is designed to provide consumers with information about energy density of food options combined with tips for healthier choices when dining out, accessible through a mobile phone.
