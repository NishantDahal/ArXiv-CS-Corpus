Agile Modeling with the UML

This paper discusses a model-based approach to software development. It argues that an approach using models as central development artifact needs to be added to the portfolio of software engineering techniques, to further increase efficiency and flexibility of the development as well as quality and reusability of the results. Two major and strongly related techniques are identified and discussed: Test case modeling and an evolutionary approach to model transformation.
