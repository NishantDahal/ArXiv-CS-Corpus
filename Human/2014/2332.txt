A Discontinuous Galerkin Time Domain Framework for Periodic Structures Subject To Oblique Excitation

A nodal Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is derived for the analysis of time-domain (TD) scattering from doubly periodic PEC/dielectric structures under oblique interrogation. Field transformations are employed to elaborate a formalism that is free from any issues with causality that are common when applying spatial periodic boundary conditions simultaneously with incident fields at arbitrary angles of incidence. An upwind numerical flux is derived for the transformed variables, which retains the same form as it does in the original Maxwell problem for domains without explicitly imposed periodicity. This, in conjunction with the amenability of the DG framework to non-conformal meshes, provides a natural means of accurately solving the first order TD Maxwell equations for a number of periodic systems of engineering interest. Results are presented that substantiate the accuracy and utility of our method.
