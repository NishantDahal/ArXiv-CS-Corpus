Piecewise Boolean algebras and their domains

We characterise piecewise Boolean domains, that is, those domains that arise as Boolean subalgebras of a piecewise Boolean algebra. This leads to equivalent descriptions of the category of piecewise Boolean algebras: either as piecewise Boolean domains equipped with an orientation, or as full structure sheaves on piecewise Boolean domains.
