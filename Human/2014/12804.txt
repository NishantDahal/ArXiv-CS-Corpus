Probabilistic Modeling of IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Functions

We introduce and analyze a new Markov model of the IEEE 802.11 Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) for wireless networks. The new model is derived from a detailed DCF description where transition probabilities are determined by precise estimates of collision probabilities based on network topology and node states. For steady state calculations, we approximate joint probabilities from marginal probabilities using product approximations. To assess the quality of the model, we compare detailed equilibrium node states with results from realistic simulations of wireless networks. We find very close correspondence between the model and the simulations in a variety of representative network topologies.
