Optimal Primary-Secondary user Cooperation Policies in Cognitive Radio Networks

In cognitive radio networks, secondary users (SUs) may cooperate with the primary user (PU), so that the success probability of PU transmissions are improved, while SUs obtain more transmission opportunities. Thus, SUs have to take intelligent decisions on whether to cooperate or not and with what power level, in order to maximize their throughput subject to average power constraints. Cooperation policies in this framework require the solution of a constrained Markov decision problem with infinite state space. In our work, we restrict attention to the class of stationary policies that take randomized decisions in every time slot based only on spectrum sensing. The proposed class of policies is shown to achieve the same set of SU rates as the more general policies, and enlarge the stability region of PU queue. Moreover, algorithms for the distributed calculation of the set of probabilities used by the proposed class of policies are presented.
