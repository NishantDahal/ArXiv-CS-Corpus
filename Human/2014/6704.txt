Out Performance Of Cuckoo Search Algorithm Among Nature Inspired Algorithms in Planar Antenna Arrays

In this modern era a great deal of metamorphism is observed around us which eventuate due to some minute modifications and innovations in the area of Science and Technology. This paper deals with the application of a meta heuristic optimization algorithm namely the Cuckoo Search Algorithm in the design of an optimized planar antenna array which ensures high gain,directivity, suppression of side lobes, increased efficiency and improves other antenna parameters as well.
