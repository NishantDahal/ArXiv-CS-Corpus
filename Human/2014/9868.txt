Agile Test-based Modeling

Model driven architecture (MDA) concentrates on the use of models during software development. An approach using models as the central development artifact is more abstract, more compact and thus more effective and probably also less error prone. Although the ideas of MDA exist already for years, there is still much to improve in the development process as well as the underlying techniques and tools. Therefore, this paper is a follow up on, reexamining und updating the statements made there. Here two major and strongly related techniques are identified and discussed: Test case modeling and an evolutionary approach to model transformation.
