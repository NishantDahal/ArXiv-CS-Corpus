Complexity Classes as Mathematical Axioms II

The second author previously discussed how classical complexity separation conjectures, we call them "axioms", have implications in three manifold topology: polynomial length stings of operations which preserve certain Jones polynomial evaluations cannot produce exponential simplifications of link diagrams. In this paper, we continue this theme, exploring now more subtle separation axioms for quantum complexity classes. Surprisingly, we now find that similar strings are unable to effect even linear simplifications of the diagrams.
