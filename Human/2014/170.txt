Never forget, whom was my ancestors: A cross-cultural analysis from Yonsei (fourth-generation Nikkei) in four societies using Data Mining

This research explains the importance of transculturality in social networking in a wide variety of activities of our daily life. We focus our analysis to online activities that use social richness, analyzing societies in Yakutia (A Russian Republic), Macau in China, Uberl√¢ndia in Brazil and Juarez City in Mexico, all with people descending from Japanese people. To this end, we performed surveys to gathering information about salient aspects of upgrade and combined them using social data mining techniques to profile a number of behavioural patterns and choices that describe social networking behaviours in these societies.
