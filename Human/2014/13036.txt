Classification of Attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks

In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), security has a vital importance. Recently, there was a huge interest to propose security solutions in WSNs because of their applications in both civilian and military domains. Adversaries can launch different types of attacks, and cryptography is used to countering these attacks. This paper presents challenges of security and a classification of the different possible attacks in WSNs. The problems of security in each layer of the network's OSI model are discussed.
