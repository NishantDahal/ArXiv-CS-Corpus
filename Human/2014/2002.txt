The Generalized Statistical Complexity of PolSAR Data

This paper presents and discusses the use of a new feature for PolSAR imagery: the Generalized Statistical Complexity. This measure is able to capture the disorder of the data by means of the entropy, as well as its departure from a reference distribution. The latter component is obtained by measuring a stochastic distance between two models: the $\mathcal G^0$ and the Gamma laws. Preliminary results on the intensity components of AIRSAR image of San Francisco are encouraging.
