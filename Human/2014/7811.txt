When data sharing gets close to 100%: what ancient human DNA studies can teach the Open Science movement

This study analyzes rates and ways of data sharing regarding mitochondrial, Y chromosomal and autosomal polymorphisms in a total of 162 papers on human ancient DNA published between 1988 and 2013. For the most part, data are available in such a way as to make their scrutiny and reuse possible. The estimated sharing rate is not far from totality (97.6% +/- 2.1%) and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic research (Evolutionary, Medical and Forensic Genetics). A questionnaire-based survey suggests that the authors awareness of the importance of openness and transparency for scientific progress is a fundamental factor for the achievement of such a high sharing rate. Most data were made available through body text, but the use of primary databases increased with the application of complete mitochondrial and next generation sequencing methods. Our study highlights three important aspects. First, we provide evidence that researchers motivations are as necessary as stakeholders policies and norms to achieve very high sharing rates. Second, careful analyses of the ways in which data are made available are an important first step to maximize data findability, accessibility, useability and preservation. Third and finally, the case of human ancient DNA studies demonstrates how Open Science can foster scientific advancements, showing that openness and transparency can help build rigorous and reliable scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental challenges.
