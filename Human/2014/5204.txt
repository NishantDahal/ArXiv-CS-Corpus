Zgoubi: A startup guide for the complete beginner

Zgoubi is a code which can be used to model accelerators and beam lines, comprised of magnetic and electrostatic elements. It has been extensively developed since the mid-1980s to include circular accelerators and related beam physics. It has been made freely available by its author on a code development site, including a Users' Guide, a data treatment/graphic interfacing tool, and many examples. This startup guide give directions to install the required elements onto a Windows or Unix system to enable running of the Zgoubi code with examples of code written to model the EMMA accelerator based at the Cockcroft Institute.
