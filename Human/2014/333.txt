A Study of Various Steganographic Techniques Used for Information Hiding

Steganography derives from the Greek word steganos, meaning covered or secret, and graphy (writing or drawing). Steganography is a technology where modern data compression, information theory, spread spectrum, and cryptography technologies are brought together to satisfy the need for privacy on the Internet. This paper is an attempt to analyse the various techniques used in steganography and to identify areas in which this technique can be applied, so that the human race can be benefited at large.
