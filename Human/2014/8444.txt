Combinatorially interpreting generalized Stirling numbers

Let $w$ be a word in alphabet $\{x,D\}$ with $m$ $x$'s and $n$ $D$'s. Interpreting "$x$" as multiplication by $x$, and "$D$" as differentiation with respect to $x$, the identity $wf(x) = x^{m-n}\sum_k S_w(k) x^k D^k f(x)$, valid for any smooth function $f(x)$, defines a sequence $(S_w(k))_k$, the terms of which we refer to as the {\em Stirling numbers (of the second kind)} of $w$. The nomenclature comes from the fact that when $w=(xD)^n$, we have $S_w(k)={n \brace k}$, the ordinary Stirling number of the second kind.
  Explicit expressions for, and identities satisfied by, the $S_w(k)$ have been obtained by numerous authors, and combinatorial interpretations have been presented. Here we provide a new combinatorial interpretation that retains the spirit of the familiar interpretation of ${n \brace k}$ as a count of partitions. Specifically, we associate to each $w$ a quasi-threshold graph $G_w$, and we show that $S_w(k)$ enumerates partitions of the vertex set of $G_w$ into classes that do not span an edge of $G_w$. We also discuss some relatives of, and consequences of, our interpretation, including $q$-analogs and bijections between families of labelled forests and sets of restricted partitions.
