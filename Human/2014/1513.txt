Abiot: A Low cost agile sonic pest control tricopter

In this paper we introduce the concept of an agile electronic pest control intelligent device for commercial usage and we have evaluated its performance in comparison with other existing similar technologies. The frequency and intensities are changed with respect to the target pest however human behavior has been found to be inert with their exposure. The unit has been tested in lab conditions as well as field testing done have given encouraging results. The device can be a standalone unit and hence work for small scale viz. kitchen garden on the other hand multiple devices acting in coordination with each other give the desired output on a larger scale.
