Analog input layer for optical reservoir computers

Reservoir computing is an information processing technique, derived from the theory of neural networks, which is easy to implement in hardware. Several reservoir computer hardware implementations have been realized recently with performance comparable to digital implementations, which demonstrated the potential of reservoir computing for ultrahigh bandwidth signal processing tasks. In all these implementations however the signal pre-processing necessary to efficiently address the reservoir was performed digitally. Here we show how this digital pre-processing can be replaced by an analog input layer. We study both numerically and experimentally to what extent the pre-processing can be replaced by a modulation of the input signal by either a single sine-wave or by a sum of two sine functions, since harmonic oscillations are particularly easy to generate in hardware. We find that the modulation by a single sine gives performance worse than state of the art. On the other hand, on many -but not all- tasks, the modulation by two sines gives performances comparable to the state of the art. The present work thus represents an important step towards fully autonomous, ultrahigh bandwidth analog reservoir computers.
