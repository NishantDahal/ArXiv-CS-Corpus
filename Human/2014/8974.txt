A measurement based software quality framework

In this report we propose a solution to problem of the dependency on the experience of the software project quality assurance personnel by providing a transparent, objective and measurement based quality framework. The framework helps the quality assurance experts making objective and comparable decisions in software projects by defining and assessing measurable quality goals and thresholds, directly relating these to an escalation mechanism. First results of applying the proposed measurement based software quality framework in a real life case study are also addressed in this report.
