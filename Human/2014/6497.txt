Two Boolean functions with five-valued Walsh spectra and high nonlinearity

For cryptographic systems the method of confusion and diffusion is used as a fundamental technique to achieve security. Confusion is reflected in nonlinearity of certain Boolean functions describing the cryptographic transformation. In this paper, we present two balanced boolean functions which have low Walsh spectra and high nonlinearity. In the proof of the nonlinearity, a new method for evaluating some exponential sums over finite fields was provided.
