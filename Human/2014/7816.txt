Concrete Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme with Verifiable Outsourced Decryption

As more sensitive data is shared and stored by third-party sites on the internet, there will be a need to encrypt data stored at these sites. One drawback of encrypting data is that it can be selectively shared only at a coarse-grained level. Attribute based encryption is a public-key-based one-to-many encryption that allows users to encrypt and decry pt data based on user attributes. A promising application of ABE is flexible access control of encrypted data stored in the cloud using access policies and ascribed attributes associated with private keys and cipher text. One.One of the main efficiency drawbacks of the existing ABE schemes is that decryption involves expensive pairing operations and the number of such operations grows with the complexity of the access policy. Finally, we show an implementation scheme and result of performance measurements, which indicates a significant reduction on computing resources imposed on users.
