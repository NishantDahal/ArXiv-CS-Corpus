From ADP to the Brain: Foundations, Roadmap, Challenges and Research Priorities

This paper defines and discusses Mouse Level Computational Intelligence (MLCI) as a grand challenge for the coming century. It provides a specific roadmap to reach that target, citing relevant work and review papers and discussing the relation to funding priorities in two NSF funding activities: the ongoing Energy, Power and Adaptive Systems program (EPAS) and the recent initiative in Cognitive Optimization and Prediction (COPN). It elaborates on the first step, vector intelligence, a challenge in the development of universal learning systems, which itself will require considerable new research to attain. This in turn is a crucial prerequisite to true functional understanding of how mammal brains achieve such general learning capabilities.
