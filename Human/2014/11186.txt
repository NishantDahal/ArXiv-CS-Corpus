Fostering of innovative usability testing to develop mobile application for mobile collaborative learning (MCL)

Emergence of latest technologies has diverted the focus of people form Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) to mobile supported collaborative learning. MCL is highly demanded in educational organizations to substantiate the pedagogical activities. Some of the MCL supportive architectures including applications are introduced in several fields to improve the activities of those organizations, but they need more concise paradigm to support both types of collaboration: synchronous and asynchronous. This paper introduces the new preusability testing method that provides educational support and gives complete picture for developing new pedagogical group application for MCL. The feature of application includes asynchronous and synchronous collaboration support. To validate the features of application, we conduct the post usability testing and heuristic evaluation, which helps in collecting the empirical data to prove the effectiveness and suitability of Group application. Further, application aims to improve learning impact and educate people at anytime and anywhere.
