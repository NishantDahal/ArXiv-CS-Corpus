IMAGINARY Math Exhibition using Low-cost 3D Printers

We have made an attempt to reproduce 17 objects of the IMAGINARY Open Mathematics Exhibition (www.imaginary.org) using low-cost, desktop 3D printers. The IMAGINARY open math is an international project by the Mathematisches Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach in Germany and includes galleries of volumetric objects that are unique, have aesthetic appeal and mathematical meaning. We illustrate here the printing of these diverse learning materials using new 3D affordable printing technologies based on Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) and the use of biodegradable plastic PLA. The final goal is to support museums, schools and higher education institutions in countries with lower scientific infrastructure.
