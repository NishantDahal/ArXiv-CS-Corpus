Toward Refactoring of DMARF and GIPSY Case Studies -- a Team 12 SOEN6471-S14 Project Report

The main significance of this document is two source systems namely GIPSY and DMARF. Intensional languages are required like GIPSY for absoluteness and forward practical investigations on the subject.DMARF mainly focuses on software architectural design and implementation on Distributed Audio recognition and its applications such as speaker identification which can run distributively on web services architecture. This mainly highlights security aspects in a distributed system, the Java data security framework (JDSF) in DMARF. ASSL (Autonomic System Specification Language) frame work is used to integrate a self-optimizing property for DMARF. GIPSY mainly depends on Higher-Order Intensional Logic (HOIL) and reflects three main goals Generality, Adaptability and Efficiency.
