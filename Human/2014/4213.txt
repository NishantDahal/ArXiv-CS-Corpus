Reduction of Field Loss by a Video Processing System

Streaming of 60 de-interlaced fields per second digital uncompressed video with 720x480 resolution without a loss of video fields is one of the desired technologies by scientists in biomechanics. If it is possible to stream digital uncompressed video without dropped video fields, then a sophisticated computer analysis of the transmitted via IEEE 1394a connection video is possible. Such process is used in biomechanics when it is important to analyze athletes performance via streaming digital uncompressed video to a computer and then analyzing it using specific software such as Arial Performance Analysis Systems.
