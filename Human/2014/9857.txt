Modelling Automotive Function Nets with Views for Features, Variants, and Modes

Modelling the logical architecture of an automotive system as one central step in the development process leads to an early understanding of the fundamental functional properties of the system under design. This supports developers in making design decisions. However, due to the large size and complexity of the system and hence the logical architecture, a good notation, method and tooling is necessary. In this paper, we show how logical architectures can be modelled succinctly as function nets using a SysML-based notation. The usefulness for developers is increased by comprehensible views on the complete model that describe automotive features, variants, and modes.
