Maximum ATSP with Weights Zero and One via Half-Edges

We present a fast combinatorial $3/4$-approximation algorithm for the maximum asymmetric TSP with weights zero and one. The approximation factor of this algorithm matches the currently best one given by Bl√§ser in 2004 and based on linear programming. Our algorithm first computes a maximum size matching and a maximum weight cycle cover without certain cycles of length two but possibly with {\em half-edges} - a half-edge of a given edge $e$ is informally speaking a half of $e$ that contains one of the endpoints of $e$. Then from the computed matching and cycle cover it extracts a set of paths, whose weight is large enough to be able to construct a traveling salesman tour with the claimed guarantee.
