Jpeg Image Compression Using Discrete Cosine Transform - A Survey

Due to the increasing requirements for transmission of images in computer, mobile environments, the research in the field of image compression has increased significantly. Image compression plays a crucial role in digital image processing, it is also very important for efficient transmission and storage of images. When we compute the number of bits per image resulting from typical sampling rates and quantization methods, we find that Image compression is needed. Therefore development of efficient techniques for image compression has become necessary .This paper is a survey for lossy image compression using Discrete Cosine Transform, it covers JPEG compression algorithm which is used for full-colour still image applications and describes all the components of it.
