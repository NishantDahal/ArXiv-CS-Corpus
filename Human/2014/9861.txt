Textbased Modeling

As modeling becomes a crucial activity in software development the question may be asked whether currently used graphical representations are the best option to model systems efficiently. This position paper discusses the advantages of text-based modeling over commonly used graphical representations. It is inspired through the advent of new extensible development tools like Eclipse. The discussion is illustrated by showing a textual version of UML state machines as Eclipse plugins.
