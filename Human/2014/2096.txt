Understanding Individual Differences: Towards Effective Mobile Interface Design and Adaptation for the Blind

No two people are alike. We usually ignore this diversity as we have the capability to adapt and, without noticing, become experts in interfaces that were probably misadjusted to begin with. This adaptation is not always at the user's reach. One neglected group is the blind. Spatial ability, memory, and tactile sensitivity are some characteristics that diverge between users. Regardless, all are presented with the same methods ignoring their capabilities and needs. Interaction with mobile devices is highly visually demanding which widens the gap between blind people. Our research goal is to identify the individual attributes that influence mobile interaction, considering the blind, and match them with mobile interaction modalities in a comprehensive and extensible design space. We aim to provide knowledge both for device design, device prescription and interface adaptation.
