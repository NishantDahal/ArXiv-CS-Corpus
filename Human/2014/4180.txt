A Novel Real-Time Video and Data Capture of Vehicular Accident in Intelligent Transportation Systems

In this paper, a novel real-time video and data capture of vehicle accident is proposed in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). The proposed scheme solves the problem of huge storage needed for recording vehicle accident in the smart vehicle and in the remote ITS server. It works efficiently with small amount of storage size and guarantee saving accident video in secondary storage. It enables user to capture real-time video and data of running vehicle. It enables user to get vehicle accident video and data anytime anywhere. The scheme is implemented using testbed and its performance is evaluated. The results show that the proposed scheme guarantees record the vehicle accident in the ITS server. The proposed scheme has better results in comparison with full time video recording scheme.
