Modified Design of Microstrip Patch Antenna for WiMAX Communication System

In this paper, a new design for U-shaped microstrip patch antenna is proposed, which can be used in WiMAX communication systems. The aim of this paper is to optimize the performance of microstrip patch antenna. Nowadays, WiMAX communication applications are widely using U-shaped microstrip patch antenna and it has become very popular. Our proposed antenna design uses 4-4.5 GHZ frequency band and it is working at narrowband within this band. RT/DUROID 5880 material is used for creating the substrate of the microstrip antenna. This modified design of the microstrip patch antenna gives high performance in terms of gain and return loss.
