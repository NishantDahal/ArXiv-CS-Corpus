A scenario based approach for dealing with challenges in a pervasive computing environment

With the surge in modern research focus towards Pervasive Computing, lot of techniques and challenges needs to be addressed so as to effectively create smart spaces and achieve miniaturization. In the process of scaling down to compact devices, the real things to ponder upon are the Information Retrieval challenges. In this work, we discuss the aspects of multimedia which makes information access challenging. An Example Pattern Recognition scenario is presented and the mathematical techniques that can be used to model uncertainty are also presented for developing a system that can sense, compute and communicate in a way that can make human life easy with smart objects assisting from around his surroundings.
