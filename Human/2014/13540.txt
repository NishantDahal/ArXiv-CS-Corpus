Temperature diagnostics of the solar atmosphere using SunPy

The solar atmosphere is a hot (about 1MK), magnetised plasma of great interest to physicists. There have been many previous studies of the temperature of the Sun's atmosphere (Plowman2012, Wit2012, Hannah2012, Aschwanden2013, etc.). Almost all of these studies use the SolarSoft software package written in the commercial Interactive Data Language (IDL), which has been the standard language for solar physics. The SunPy project aims to provide an open-source library for solar physics. This work presents (to the authors' knowledge) the first study of its type to use SunPy rather than SolarSoft. This work uses SunPy to process multi-wavelength solar observations made by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and produce temperature maps of the Sun's atmosphere. The method uses SunPy's utilities for querying databases of solar events, downloading solar image data, storing and processing images as spatially aware Map objects, and tracking solar features as the Sun rotates. An essential consideration in developing this software is computational efficiency due to the large amount of data collected by AIA/SDO, and in anticipating new solar missions which will result in even larger sets of data. An overview of the method and implementation is given, along with tests involving synthetic data and examples of results using real data for various regions in the Sun's atmosphere.
