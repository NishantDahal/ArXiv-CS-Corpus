Component Based Software Development: A State of Art

One of the goals of Software design is to model a system in such a way that it is reused. Actively reusing designs or code allows taking advantage of the investment made on reusable components. However development of domain specific components and its impact on effort in terms of cost and time is still a challenging issue. The component based technology has transformed over a period of time from a simple component to the domain specific components. This paper presents a state of art of the drastic change in component technology from component engineering to domain engineering.
