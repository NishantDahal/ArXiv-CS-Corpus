Expression driven Trignometric based Procedural Animation of Quadrupeds

This research paper addresses the problem of generating involuntary and precise animation of quadrupeds with automatic rigging system of various character types. The technique proposed through this research is based on a two tier animation control curve with base simulation being driven through dynamic mathematical model using procedural algorithm and the top layer with a custom user controlled animation provided with intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). The character rig is based on forward and inverse kinematics driven through trigonometric based motion equations. The User is provided with various manipulators and attributes to control and handle the locomotion gaits of the characters and choose between various types of simulated motions from walking, running, trotting, ambling and galloping with complete custom controls to easily extend the base simulation as per requirements.
