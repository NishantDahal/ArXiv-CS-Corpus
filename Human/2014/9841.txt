A Concept Learning Approach to Multisensory Object Perception

This paper presents a computational model of concept learning using Bayesian inference for a grammatically structured hypothesis space, and test the model on multisensory (visual and haptics) recognition of 3D objects. The study is performed on a set of artificially generated 3D objects known as fribbles, which are complex, multipart objects with categorical structures. The goal of this work is to develop a working multisensory representational model that integrates major themes on concepts and concepts learning from the cognitive science literature. The model combines the representational power of a probabilistic generative grammar with the inferential power of Bayesian induction.
