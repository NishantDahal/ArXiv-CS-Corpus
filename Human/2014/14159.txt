Automatic adaptor synthesis for protocol transformation

Adaptation of software components is an important issue in Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE). Building a system from reusable or Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components introduces a set of issues, mainly related to compatibility and communication aspects. Components may have incompatible interaction behavior. Moreover it might be necessary to enhance the current communication protocol to introduce more sophisticated interactions among components. We address these problems enhancing our architectural approach which allows for detection and recovery of integration mismatches by synthesizing a suitable coordinator. Starting from the specification of the system to be assembled and from the specification of the needed protocol enhancements, our framework automatically derives, in a compositional way, the glue code for the set of components. The synthesized glue code avoids interaction mismatches and provides a protocol-enhanced version of the composed system.
