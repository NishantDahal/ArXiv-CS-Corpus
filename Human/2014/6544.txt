Embedded Controlled Languages

Inspired by embedded programming languages, an embedded CNL (controlled natural language) is a proper fragment of an entire natural language (its host language), but it has a parser that recognizes the entire host language. This makes it possible to process out-of-CNL input and give useful feedback to users, instead of just reporting syntax errors. This extended abstract explains the main concepts of embedded CNL implementation in GF (Grammatical Framework), with examples from machine translation and some other ongoing work.
