Visualization of Constraint Handling Rules

Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) has matured into a general purpose language over the past two decades. Any general purpose language requires its own development tools. Visualization tools, in particular, facilitate many tasks for programmers as well as beginners to the language. The article presents on-going work towards the visualization of CHR programs. The process is done through source-to-source transformation. It aims towards reaching a generic transformer to visualize different algorithms implemented in CHR.
