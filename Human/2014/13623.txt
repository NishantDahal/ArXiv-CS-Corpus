Contour Detection Using Contrast Formulas in the Framework of Logarithmic Models

In this paper we use a new logarithmic model of image representation, developed in [1,2], for edge detection. In fact, in the framework of the new model we obtain the formulas for computing the "contrast of a pixel" and the "contrast" image is just the "contour" or edge image. In our setting the range of values is preserved and the quality of the contour is good for high as well as for low luminosity regions. We present the comparison of our results with the results using classical edge detection operators.
