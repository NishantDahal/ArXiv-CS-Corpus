GCD Computation of n Integers

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) computation is one of the most important operation of algorithmic number theory. In this paper we present the algorithms for GCD computation of $n$ integers. We extend the Euclid's algorithm and binary GCD algorithm to compute the GCD of more than two integers.
