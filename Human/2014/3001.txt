Application of Particle Swarm Optimization to Microwave Tapered Microstrip Lines

Application of metaheuristic algorithms has been of continued interest in the field of electrical engineering because of their powerful features. In this work special design is done for a tapered transmission line used for matching an arbitrary real load to a 50Ω line. The problem at hand is to match this arbitrary load to 50 Ω line using three section tapered transmission line with impedances in decreasing order from the load. So the problem becomes optimizing an equation with three unknowns with various conditions. The optimized values are obtained using Particle Swarm Optimization. It can easily be shown that PSO is very strong in solving this kind of multiobjective optimization problems.
