Weight Distributions of a Class of Cyclic Codes with Arbitrary Number of Zeros II

Cyclic codes are an important class of linear codes, whose weight distribution have been extensively studied. So far, most of previous results obtained were for cyclic codes with no more than three zeros. Recently, \cite{Y-X-D12} constructed a class of cyclic codes with arbitrary number of zeros, and computed the weight distributions for several cases. In this paper, we determine the weight distribution for a new family of such codes. This is achieved by certain new methods, such as the theory of Jacobi sums over finite fields and subtle treatment of some complicated combinatorial identities.
