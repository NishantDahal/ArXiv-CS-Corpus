A weight-distribution bound for entropy extractors using linear binary codes

We consider a bound on the bias reduction of a random number generator by processing based on binary linear codes. We introduce a new bound on the total variation distance of the processed output based on the weight distribution of the code generated by the chosen binary matrix. Starting from this result we show a lower bound for the entropy rate of the output of linear binary extractors.
