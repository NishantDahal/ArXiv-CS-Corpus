The proposal of improved component selection framework

Component selection is considered one of hard tasks in Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE). It is difficult to find the optimal component selection. CBSE is an approach that is used to develop a software system from pre-existing software components. Appropriate software component selection plays an important role in CBSE. Many approaches were suggested to solve component selection problem. In this paper the component selection is done by improving the integrated component selection framework by including the pliability metric. Pliability is a flexible measure that assesses software quality in terms of its components quality. The validation of this proposed solution is done through collecting a sample of people who answer an electronic questionnaire that composed of 20 questions. The questionnaire is distributed through social sites such as Twitter, Facebook and emails. The result of the validation showed that using the integrated component selection framework with pliability metric is suitable for component selection.
