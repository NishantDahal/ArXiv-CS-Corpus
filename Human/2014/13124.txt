Weakly Submodular Functions

Submodular functions are well-studied in combinatorial optimization, game theory and economics. The natural diminishing returns property makes them suitable for many applications. We study an extension of monotone submodular functions, which we call {\em weakly submodular functions}. Our extension includes some (mildly) supermodular functions. We show that several natural functions belong to this class and relate our class to some other recent submodular function extensions.
  We consider the optimization problem of maximizing a weakly submodular function subject to uniform and general matroid constraints. For a uniform matroid constraint, the "standard greedy algorithm" achieves a constant approximation ratio where the constant (experimentally) converges to 5.95 as the cardinality constraint increases. For a general matroid constraint, a simple local search algorithm achieves a constant approximation ratio where the constant (analytically) converges to 10.22 as the rank of the matroid increases.
