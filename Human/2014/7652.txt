Synthesis of a simple self-stabilizing system

With the increasing importance of distributed systems as  a computing paradigm, a  systematic approach to their design is needed. Although the area of formal verification has made enormous advances towards this goal, the resulting functionalities are limited to detecting problems in a particular design. By means of a classical example,  we illustrate a simple template-based approach to computer-aided design of distributed systems based on leveraging the well-known technique of bounded model checking to the synthesis setting.
