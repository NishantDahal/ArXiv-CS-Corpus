The world is moving faster each day with several events taking place at once and the Internet is flooded with information in every field. There are categories of information ranging from most relevant to user, to the information totally irrelevant or less relevant to specific users. In such a scenario getting the information which is most relevant to the user is indispensable to save time. The motivation of our solution is based on the idea of optimizing the search for information automatically. This information is delivered to user in the form of an interactive GUI. The optimization of the contents or information served to him is based on his social networking profiles and on his reading habits on the proposed solution. The aim is to get the user's profile information based on his social networking profile considering that almost every Internet user has one.
