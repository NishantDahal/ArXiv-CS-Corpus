Quantum Edge Detection for Image Segmentation in Optical Environments

A quantum edge detector for image segmentation in optical environments is presented in this work. A Boolean version of the same detector is presented too. The quantum version of the new edge detector works with computational basis states, exclusively. This way, we can easily avoid the problem of quantum measurement retrieving the result of applying the new detector on the image. Besides, a new criterion and logic based on projections onto vertical axis of Bloch's Sphere exclusively are presented too. This approach will allow us: 1) a simpler development of logic quantum operations, where they will closer to those used in the classical logic operations, 2) building simple and robust classical-to-quantum and quantum-to-classical interfaces. Said so far is extended to quantum algorithms outside image processing too. In a special section on metric and simulations, a new metric based on the comparison between the classical and quantum versions algorithms for edge detection of images is presented. Notable differences between the results of classical and quantum versions of such algorithms (outside and inside of quantum computer, respectively) show the existence of implementation problems involved in the experiment, and that they have not been properly modeled for optical environments. However, although they are different, the quantum results are equally valid. The latter is clearly seen in the computer simulations
