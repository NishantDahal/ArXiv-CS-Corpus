Quantum fully homomorphic encryption scheme based on universal quantum circuit

Fully homomorphic encryption enables arbitrary computation on encrypted data without decrypting the data. Here it is studied in the context of quantum information processing. Based on universal quantum circuit, we present a quantum fully homomorphic encryption (QFHE) scheme, which permits arbitrary quantum transformation on an encrypted data. The QFHE scheme is proved to be perfectly secure. In the scheme, the decryption key is different from the encryption key, however, the encryption key cannot be public. Moreover, the evaluate algorithm of the scheme is independent of the encryption key, so it is very applicable in delegated quantum computing between two parties.
