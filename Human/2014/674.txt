2D Direction Of Arrival Estimation with Modified Propagator

In this paper, a fast algorithm for the Direction Of Arrival (DOA) estimation of radiating sources, based on partial covariance matrix and without eigende- composition of incoming signals is extended to two dimensional problem of joint azimuth and elevation estimation angles using Uniform Circular Array (UCA) in case of non coherent narrowband signals. Simulation results are presented with both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and real symmetric Toeplitz noise.
