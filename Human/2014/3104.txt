Vehicle as a Resource (VaaR)

Intelligent vehicles are considered key enablers for intelligent transportation systems. They are equipped with resources/components to enable services for vehicle occupants, other vehicles on the road, and third party recipients. In-vehicle sensors, communication modules, and on-board units with computing and storage capabilities allow the intelligent vehicle to work as a mobile service provider of sensing, data storage, computing, cloud, data relaying, infotainment, and localization services. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Vehicle as a Resource (VaaR) and shed light on the services a vehicle can potentially provide on the road or parked. We anticipate that an intelligent vehicle can be a significant service provider in a variety of situations, including emergency scenarios.
