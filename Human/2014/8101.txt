On the Capacity of CSI Based Transmission Link Selection in Decode-and-Forward Cooperative System

In this paper, we study the problem of best transmission link selection in a decode-and-forward (DF) cooperative system from capacity point of view. The transmission link can be a cooperative (via a relay) or direct link between the source and destination nodes. In a two-hop DF system with multiple relays and a direct link in between the source and destination, the transmission link selection can be performed based on full or partial channel state information (CSI) of all links involved in cooperation. We derive analytical ergodic capacity of full and partial CSI based path selection schemes in the DF cooperative system. Further, the full and partial CSI based link selection schemes are compared with help of these expressions.
