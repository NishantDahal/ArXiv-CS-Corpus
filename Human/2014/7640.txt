Research of Load Testing and Result Based on Loadrunner

In this paper, we made the plan of a load testing, and got results by means of the LoadRunner which is an automatic load testing tool.We combined with the characteristics of electronic commerce system and did the load testing and analysis the result of load test by means of the LoadRunner. We fully described the characteristics of the electronic commerce application, designed the reasonable test cases,and simulated the practical scenario. In the process of running Load Runner, we arranged the appropriate transactions and rendezvous, and designed the truthful test network environment. The plan was applied to the load testing phase of the telecommunication equipment sales system of special products. We analyzed the load testing results, proposed the improving measures, and realized the optimization of the telecommunication equipment sales system and also found the defect of the system when the massive users access the system and guided the system improvement using the test result.
