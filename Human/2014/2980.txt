Encapsulating Formal Methods within Domain Specific Languages: A Solution for Verifying Railway Scheme Plans

The development and application of formal methods is a long standing research topic within the field of computer science. One particular challenge that remains is the uptake of formal methods into industrial practices. This paper introduces a methodology for developing domain specific languages for modelling and verification to aid in the uptake of formal methods within industry. It illustrates the successful application of this methodology within the railway domain. The presented methodology addresses issues surrounding faithful modelling, scalability of verification and accessibility to modelling and verification processes for practitioners within the domain.
