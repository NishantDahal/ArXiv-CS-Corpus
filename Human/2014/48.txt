Powers of Tensors and Fast Matrix Multiplication

This paper presents a method to analyze the powers of a given trilinear form (a special kind of algebraic constructions also called a tensor) and obtain upper bounds on the asymptotic complexity of matrix multiplication. Compared with existing approaches, this method is based on convex optimization, and thus has polynomial-time complexity. As an application, we use this method to study powers of the construction given by Coppersmith and Winograd [Journal of Symbolic Computation, 1990] and obtain the upper bound $Ï‰<2.3728639$ on the exponent of square matrix multiplication, which slightly improves the best known upper bound.
