Fundamental Limits of Video Coding: A Closed-form Characterization of Rate Distortion Region from First Principles

Classical motion-compensated video coding methods have been standardized by MPEG over the years and video codecs have become integral parts of media entertainment applications. Despite the ubiquitous use of video coding techniques, it is interesting to note that a closed form rate-distortion characterization for video coding is not available in the literature. In this paper, we develop a simple, yet, fundamental characterization of rate-distortion region in video coding based on information-theoretic first principles. The concept of conditional motion estimation is used to derive the closedform expression for rate-distortion region without losing its generality. Conditional motion estimation offers an elegant means to analyze the rate-distortion trade-offs and demonstrates the viability of achieving the bounds derived. The concept involves classifying image regions into active and inactive based on the amount of motion activity. By appropriately modeling the residuals corresponding to active and inactive regions, a closed form expression for rate-distortion function is derived in terms of motion activity and spatio-temporal correlation that commonly exist in video content. Experiments on real video clips using H.264 codec are presented to demonstrate the practicality and validity of the proposed rate-distortion analysis.
