A Uniquely Ergodic Cellular Automaton

We construct a one-dimensional uniquely ergodic cellular automaton which is not nilpotent. This automaton can perform asymptotically infinitely sparse computation, which nevertheless never disappears completely. The construction builds on the self-simulating automaton of GÃ¡cs. We also prove related results of dynamical and computational nature, including the undecidability of unique ergodicity, and the undecidability of nilpotency in uniquely ergodic cellular automata.
