Enhancing Dictionary Based Preprocessing For Better Text Compression

With the rapid growing of data and number of applications, there is a crucial need of dictionary based reversible transformation techniques to increase the efficiency of the compression algorithms and hence contribute towards the enhancement in compression ratio. Performance analysis of compression methods in combination with the various transformation techniques is obtained for different text files of varying sizes. The popular block sorting lossless Burrows Wheeler Compression Algorithm (BWCA) is implemented along with one proposed method. For efficient compression a dictionary based transformation algorithm is also developed. It is observed that much increase in terms of compression ratio is attained when a source file is preprocessed with dictionary and then applied to BWCA and the proposed method.
