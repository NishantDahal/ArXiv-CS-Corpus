An Improved Node Ranking for Label Propagation and Modularity based Clustering

In this paper I'll speak about non-spectral clustering techniques and see how a node ordering based on centrality measures can improve the quality of communities detected. I'll also discuss an improvement to existing techniques, which further improves modularity.
