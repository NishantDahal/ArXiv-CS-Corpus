A Molecular Communication Link for Monitoring in Confined Environments

In this paper, we consider a molecular diffusion based communications link that can reliably transport data over-the-air. We show that the system can also reliably transport data across confined structural environments, especially in cases where conventional electromagnetic (EM) wave based systems may fail. In particular, this paper compares the performance of our proprietary molecular communication test-bed with Zigbee wireless sensors in a metal pipe network that does not act as a radio wave-guide. The paper first shows that a molecular-based communication link's performance is determined primarily by the delay time spread of the pulse response. The paper go on to show that molecular-based systems can transmit more reliably in complex and confined structural environments than conventional EM-based systems. The paper then utilizes empirical data to find relationships between the received radio signal strength, the molecular pulse spread, data rate (0.1 bits/s) and the structural propagation environment.
