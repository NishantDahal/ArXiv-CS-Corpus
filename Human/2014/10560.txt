A Note on Cross Correlation Distribution of Ternary m-Sequences

In this note, we prove a conjecture proposed by Tao Zhang, Shuxing Li, Tao Feng and Gennian Ge, IEEE Transaction on Information Theory, vol. 60, no. 5, May 2014. This conjecture is about the cross correlation distribution of ternary $m$-sequences.
