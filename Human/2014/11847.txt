Fault Modelling in System-of-Systems Contracts

The nature of Systems of Systems (SoSs), large complex systems composed of independent, geographically distributed and continuously evolving constituent systems, means that faults are unavoidable. Previous work on defining contractual specifications of the constituent systems of SoSs does not provide any explicit consideration for faults. In this paper we address that gap by extending an existing pattern for modelling contracts with fault modelling concepts. The proposed extensions are introduced with respect to an Audio Visual SoS case study from Bang and Olufsen, before discussing how they relate to previous work on modelling faults in SoSs.
