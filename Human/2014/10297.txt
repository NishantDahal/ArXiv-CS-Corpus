Extensible Validation Framework for DSLs using MontiCore on the Example of Coding Guidelines

Unit test environments are today's state of the art for many programming languages to keep the software's quality above a certain level. However, the software's syntactic quality necessary for the developers themselves is not covered by the aforementioned frameworks. This paper presents a tool realized using the DSL framework MontiCore for automatically validating easily extensible coding guidelines for any domain specific language or even general purpose languages like C++ and its application in an automotive R&D project where a German OEM and several suppliers were involved. Moreover, it was exemplary applied on UML/P-based sequence charts as well.
