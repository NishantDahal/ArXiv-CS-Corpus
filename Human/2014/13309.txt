Dilation of states and processes in operational-probabilistic theories

This paper  provides a concise summary of the framework of operational-probabilistic theories, aimed at  emphasizing the interaction between  category-theoretic and probabilistic structures.  Within this framework,  we review an operational version of the GNS construction,  expressed by the so-called  purification principle, which under mild hypotheses leads to an operational version of Stinespring's theorem.
