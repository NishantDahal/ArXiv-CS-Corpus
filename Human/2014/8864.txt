Data clustering is the process of identifying natural groupings or clusters within multidimensional data based on some similarity measure. Clustering is a fundamental process in many different disciplines. Hence, researchers from different fields are actively working on the clustering problem. This paper provides an overview of the different representative clustering methods. In addition, application of clustering in different field is briefly introduced.
