A Polylogarithmic PRG for Degree $2$ Threshold Functions in the Gaussian Setting

We devise a new pseudorandom generator against degree 2 polynomial threshold functions in the Gaussian setting. We manage to achieve $ε$ error with seed length polylogarithmic in $ε$ and the dimension, and exponential improvement over previous constructions.
