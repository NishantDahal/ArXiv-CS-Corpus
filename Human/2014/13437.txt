Toward Refactoring of DMARF and GIPSY Case Studies -- A Team XI SOEN6471-S14 Project Report

This report focuses on improving the internal structure of the Distributed Modular Audio recognition Framework (DMARF) and the General Intensional Programming System (GIPSY) case studies without affecting their original behavior. At first, the general principles, and the working of DMARF and GIPSY are understood by mainly stressing on the architecture of the systems by looking at their frameworks and running them in the Eclipse environment. To improve the quality of the structure of the code, a furtherance of understanding of the architecture of the case studies and this is achieved by analyzing the design patterns present in the code. The improvement is done by the identification and removal of code smells in the code of the case studies. Code smells are identified by analyzing the source code by using Logiscope and JDeodorant. Some refactoring techniques are suggested, out of which the best suited ones are implemented to improve the code. Finally, Test cases are implemented to check if the behavior of the code has changed or not.
