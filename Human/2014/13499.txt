Representation of (Left) Ideal Regular Languages by Synchronizing Automata

We follow language theoretic approach to synchronizing automata and Černý's conjecture initiated in a series of recent papers. We find a precise lower bound for the reset complexity of a principal ideal languages. Also we show a strict connection between principal left ideals and synchronizing automata. We characterize regular languages whose minimal deterministic finite automaton is synchronizing and possesses a reset word belonging to the recognized language.
