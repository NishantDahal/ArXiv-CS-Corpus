Analysis of Carrier Frequency Selective Offset Estimation - Using Zero-IF and ZCZIn MC-DS-CDMA

A new method for frequency synchronization based upon Zero-Intermediate Frequency Zero-IF receiver and characteristics of the received signal s power spectrum for MC-DSCDMA Up link system is proposed in this paper. In addition to this, employing Zero Correlation Zone (ZCZ) sequences, designed specifically for quasi synchronous up link transmissions, is proposed to exploit frequency and temporal diversity in frequency-selective block fading channels. The variance for Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) estimators of MC DS CDMA Uplink is compared with that of an OFDM system to estimate the CFO. Our study and results show that the MC DS CDMA system is outperforming the OFDM method
