A New Result on the Random Residue Sequence Algorithm

Random residue sequences (RR) may be used in many random number applications including those related to multiple access in communications. This paper investigates variations on an algorithm to generate RR sequences that was proposed earlier by the author. This makes it possible to obtain many more random sequences than was possible to do by the previous algorithm. Experimental results are presented on a variety of sequences of length 16 and 24. To obtain a variety of RR sequences of a specific length can have obvious applications in cryptography.
