A Low-Complexity Algorithm for Throughput Maximization in Wireless Powered Communication Networks

This paper investigates a wireless powered communication network (WPCN) under the protocol of harvest-then-transmit,where a hybrid access point with constant power supply replenishes the passive user nodes by wireless power transfer in the downlink,then each user node transmit independent information to the hybrid AP in a time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme in the uplink.The sum-throughput maximization and min-throughput maximization problems are considered in this paper.The optimal time allocation for the sum-throughput maximization is proposed based on the Jensen's inequality,which provides more insight into the design of WPCNs.A low-complexity fixed-point iteration algorithm for the min-throughput maximization problem,which promises a much better computation complexity than the state-of-the-art algorithm.Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
