A new Watermarking Technique for Medical Image using Hierarchical Encryption

In recent years, characterized by the innovation of technology and the digital revolution, the field of media has become important. The transfer and exchange of multimedia data and duplication have become major concerns of researchers. Consequently, protecting copyrights and ensuring service safety is needed. Cryptography has a specific role, is to protect secret files against unauthorized access. In this paper, a hierarchical cryptosystem algorithm based on Logistic Map chaotic systems is proposed. The results show that the proposed method improves the security of the image. Experimental results on a database of 200 medical images show that the proposed method significantly gives better results.
