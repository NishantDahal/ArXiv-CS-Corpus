A decoding algorithm for CSS codes using the X/Z correlations

We propose a simple decoding algorithm for CSS codes taking into account the correlations between the X part and the Z part of the error. Applying this idea to surface codes, we derive an improved version of the perfect matching decoding algorithm which uses these X/Z correlations.
