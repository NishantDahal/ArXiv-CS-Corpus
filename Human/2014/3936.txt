Comparison of the Research Effectiveness of Chemistry Nobelists and Fields Medalist Mathematicians with Google Scholar: the Yule-Simon Model

This paper uses the Yule-Simon model to estimate to what extent the work of chemistry Nobelists and Fields medalist mathematicians is incorporated into the knowledge corpus of their disciplines as measured by Google Scholar inlinks. Due to differences in the disciplines and prizes, it finds that the work of chemistry Nobelists is better incorporated than that of Fields medalists.
