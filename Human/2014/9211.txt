Max-SINR Receiver for HMCT Systems over Non-Stationary Doubly Dispersive Channel

In this paper, a maximizing Signal-to-Interference plus-Noise Ratio (Max-SINR) receiver for Hexagonal Multicarrier Transmission (HMCT) system over non-stationary doubly dispersive (NSDD) channel is proposed. The closed-form timing offset expression of the prototype pulse for the proposed Max-SINR HMCT receiver over NSDD channel is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed Max-SINR receiver outperforms traditional projection scheme and obtains an approximation to the theoretical upper bound SINR performance within all the local stationarity regions (LSRs). Meanwhile, the SINR performance of the proposed Max-SINR HMCT receiver is robust to the estimation error between the estimated value and the real value of root mean square (RMS) delay spread.
