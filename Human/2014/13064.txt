Introduction to RIMEP2: A Multi-Expression Programming System for the Design of Reversible Digital Circuits

Quantum computers are considered as a future alternative to circumvent the heat dissipation problem of VLSI circuits. The synthesis of reversible circuits is a very promising area of study considering the expected further technological advances towards quantum computing. In this report, we propose a linear genetic programming system to design reversible circuits -RIMEP2-. The system has evolved reversible circuits starting from scratch without resorting to a pre-existing library. The results show that among the 26 considered benchmarks, RIMEP2 outperformed the best published solutions for 20 of them and matched the remaining 6. RIMEP2 is presented in this report as a promising method with a considerable potential for reversible circuit design. It will be considered as work reference for future studies based on this method.
