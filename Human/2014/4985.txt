A Topic Model Approach to Multi-Modal Similarity

Calculating similarities between objects defined by many heterogeneous data modalities is an important challenge in many multimedia applications. We use a multi-modal topic model as a basis for defining such a similarity between objects. We propose to compare the resulting similarities from different model realizations using the non-parametric Mantel test. The approach is evaluated on a music dataset.
