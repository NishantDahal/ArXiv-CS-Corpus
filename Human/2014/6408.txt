Knowledge Representation in Agent's Logic with Uncertainty and Agent's Interaction

This paper studies knowledge representation in multi-agent environment. We investigate technique for computation truth-values of statements based at a new temporal, agent's-knowledge logic TL. A logical language, mathematical symbolic models and a temporal logic TL based at these models are suggested. We find an algorithm which computes theorems of TL and satisfiability of statements, this implies that TL is decidable (i.e. -- the satisfiability problem for TL is solvable). Application areas are pointed and discussed.
