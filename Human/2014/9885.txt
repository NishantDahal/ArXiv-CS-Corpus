The WebShop E-Commerce Framework

This paper presents an e-commerce framework called WebShop, which was developed by the authors for the purpose of demonstrating the use of UML and the UML-F in the domain of Web applications. Thus, the WebShop is not regarded as a full-fledged system out of which real Web stores can be derived. For example, the framework in the presented version does not encounter security features. However, it presents the most important variation points related to online catalogs. The UML-F Web site http://www.UML-F.net provides the Java source files and some sample adaptations of WebShop.
