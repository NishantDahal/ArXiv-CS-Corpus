A Comparative Study of Audio Compression Based on Compressed Sensing and Sparse Fast Fourier Transform (SFFT): Performance and Challenges

Audio compression has become one of the basic multimedia technologies. Choosing an efficient compression scheme that is capable of preserving the signal quality while providing a high compression ratio is desirable in the different standards worldwide. In this paper we study the application of two highly acclaimed sparse signal processing algorithms, namely, Compressed Sensing (CS) and Sparse Fart Fourier transform, to audio compression. In addition, we present a Sparse Fast Fourier transform (SFFT)-based framework to compress audio signal. This scheme embeds the K-largest frequencies indices as part of the transmitted signal and thus saves in the bandwidth required for transmission
