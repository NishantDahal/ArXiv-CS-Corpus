Emerging Technologies and Research Challenges for 5G Wireless Networks

As the take-up of Long Term Evolution (LTE)/4G cellular accelerates, there is increasing interest in technologies that will define the next generation (5G) telecommunication standard. This paper identifies several emerging technologies which will change and define the future generations of telecommunication standards. Some of these technologies are already making their way into standards such as 3GPP LTE, while others are still in development. Additionally, we will look at some of the research problems that these new technologies pose.
