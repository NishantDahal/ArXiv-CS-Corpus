Optimal Caching and Routing in Hybrid Networks

Hybrid networks consisting of MANET nodes and cellular infrastructure have been recently proposed to improve the performance of military networks. Prior work has demonstrated the benefits of in-network content caching in a wired, Internet context. We investigate the problem of developing optimal routing and caching policies in a hybrid network supporting in-network caching with the goal of minimizing overall content-access delay. Here, needed content may always be accessed at a back-end server via the cellular infrastructure; alternatively, content may also be accessed via cache-equipped "cluster" nodes within the MANET. To access content, MANET nodes must thus decide whether to route to in-MANET cluster nodes or to back-end servers via the cellular infrastructure; the in-MANET cluster nodes must additionally decide which content to cache. We model the cellular path as either i) a congestion-insensitive fixed-delay path or ii) a congestion-sensitive path modeled as an M/M/1 queue. We demonstrate that under the assumption of stationary, independent requests, it is optimal to adopt static caching (i.e., to keep a cache's content fixed over time) based on content popularity. We also show that it is optimal to route to in-MANET caches for content cached there, but to route requests for remaining content via the cellular infrastructure for the congestion-insensitive case and to split traffic between the in-MANET caches and cellular infrastructure for the congestion-sensitive case. We develop a simple distributed algorithm for the joint routing/caching problem and demonstrate its efficacy via simulation.
