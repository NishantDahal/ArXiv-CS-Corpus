A feasible roadmap for developing volumetric probability atlas of localized prostate cancer

A statistical volumetric model, showing the probability map of localized prostate cancer within the host anatomical structure, has been developed from 90 optically-imaged surgical specimens. This master model permits an accurate characterization of prostate cancer distribution patterns and an atlas-informed biopsy sampling strategy. The model is constructed by mapping individual prostate models onto a site model, together with localized tumors. An accurate multi-object non-rigid warping scheme is developed based on a mixture of principal-axis registrations. We report our evaluation and pilot studies on the effectiveness of the method and its application to optimizing needle biopsy strategies.
