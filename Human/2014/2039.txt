TDOA--based localization in two dimensions: the bifurcation curve

In this paper, we complete the study of the geometry of the TDOA map that encodes the noiseless model for the localization of a source from the range differences between three receivers in a plane, by computing the Cartesian equation of the bifurcation curve in terms of the positions of the receivers. From that equation, we can compute its real asymptotic lines. The present manuscript completes the analysis of [Inverse Problems, Vol. 30, Number 3, Pages 035004]. Our result is useful to check if a source belongs or is closed to the bifurcation curve, where the localization in a noisy scenario is ambiguous.
