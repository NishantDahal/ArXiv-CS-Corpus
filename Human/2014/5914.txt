Graver Bases and Universal Gröbner Bases for Linear Codes

Two correspondences have been provided that associate any linear code over a finite field with a binomial ideal. In this paper, algorithms for computing their Graver bases and universal Gröbner bases are given. To this end, a connection between these binomial ideals and toric ideals will be established.
