Priority-based task reassignments in hierarchical 2D mesh-connected systems using tableaux

Task reassignments in 2D mesh-connected systems (2D-MSs) have been researched for several decades. We propose a hierarchical 2D mesh-connected system (2D-HMS) in order to exploit the regular nature of a 2D-MS. In our approach priority-based task assignments and reassignments in a 2D-HMS are represented by tableaux and their algorithms. We show how task relocations for a priority-based task reassignment in a 2D-HMS are reduced to a jeu de taquin slide.
