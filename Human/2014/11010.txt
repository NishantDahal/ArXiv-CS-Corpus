Iris Biometric System using a hybrid approach

Iris Recognition Systems are ocular- based biometric devices used primarily for security reasons. The complexity and the randomness of the Iris, amongst various other factors, ensure that this biometric system is inarguably an exact and reliable method of identification. The algorithm is responsible for automatic localization and segmentation of boundaries using circular Hough Transform, noise reductions, image enhancement and feature extraction across numerous distinct images present in the database. This paper delves into the various kinds of techniques required to approximate the pupillary and limbic boundaries of the enrolled iris image, captured using a suitable image acquisition device and perform feature extraction on the normalized iris image with the help of Haar Wavelets to encode the input data into a binary string format. These techniques were validated using images from the CASIA database, and various other procedures were also tried and tested.
