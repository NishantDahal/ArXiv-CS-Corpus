Image reconstruction from limited range projections using orthogonal moments

A set of orthonormal polynomials is proposed for image reconstruction from projection data. The relationship between the projection moments and image moments is discussed in detail, and some interesting properties are demonstrated. Simulation results are provided to validate the method and to compare its performance with previous works.
