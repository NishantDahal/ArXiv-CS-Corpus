Validation Experiments for LBM Simulations of Electron Beam Melting

This paper validates 3D simulation results of electron beam melting (EBM) processes comparing experimental and numerical data. The physical setup is presented which is discretized by a three dimensional (3D) thermal lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). An experimental process window is used for the validation depending on the line energy injected into the metal powder bed and the scan velocity of the electron beam. In the process window the EBM products are classified into the categories, porous, good and swelling, depending on the quality of the surface. The same parameter sets are used to generate a numerical process window. A comparison of numerical and experimental process windows shows a good agreement. This validates the EBM model and justifies simulations for future improvements of EBM processes. In particular numerical simulations can be used to explain future process window scenarios and find the best parameter set for a good surface quality and dense products.
