A Survey on optimization approaches to text document clustering

Text Document Clustering is one of the fastest growing research areas because of availability of huge amount of information in an electronic form. There are several number of techniques launched for clustering documents in such a way that documents within a cluster have high intra-similarity and low inter-similarity to other clusters. Many document clustering algorithms provide localized search in effectively navigating, summarizing, and organizing information. A global optimal solution can be obtained by applying high-speed and high-quality optimization algorithms. The optimization technique performs a globalized search in the entire solution space. In this paper, a brief survey on optimization approaches to text document clustering is turned out.
