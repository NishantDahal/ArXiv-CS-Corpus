Morphological Analysis of the Bishnupriya Manipuri Language using Finite State Transducers

In this work we present a morphological analysis of Bishnupriya Manipuri language, an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the north eastern India. As of now, there is no computational work available for the language. Finite state morphology is one of the successful approaches applied in a wide variety of languages over the year. Therefore we adapted the finite state approach to analyse morphology of the Bishnupriya Manipuri language.
