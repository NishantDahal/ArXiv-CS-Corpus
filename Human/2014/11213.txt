Aspects and challenges of mashup creator design

With the advent of Web 2.0, an increasing number of web sites has started offering their data over the web in standard formats and exposed their functionality as APIs. A new type of applications has taken advantage of the new data and services available by mixing them, in order to generate new applications fast and efficiently, getting its name from its own architectural style: mashups. A set of applications that aims to help a user create, deploy and manage his mashups has also emerged, using various approaches. In this paper we discuss the key factors that should be taken into consideration when designing a mashup creator, along with the most important challenges that offer a field for research.
