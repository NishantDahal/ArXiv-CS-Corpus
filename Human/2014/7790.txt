Correct-by-design Control Synthesis for Multilevel Converters using State Space Decomposition

High-power converters based on elementary switching cells are more and  more used in the industry of power electronics owing to various advantages such as lower voltage  stress and reduced power loss. However, the complexity of controlling such converters is a major  challenge that  the power manufacturing industry has to face with. The synthesis of  industrial  switching controllers relies today on heuristic rules and empiric simulation. The state of the system is not guaranteed to stay within the limits that are admissible for its correct electrical behavior. We show here how to apply a formal method in order to synthesize a correct-by-design control that guarantees that the power converter will always stay within a predefined safe zone of  variations for its input parameters. The method is applied in order to synthesize a correct-by-design control for 5-level and 7-level power converters  with a flying capacitor topology. We check the validity of our approach by numerical simulations for 5 and 7 levels. We also perform physical experimentations using a prototype built by SATIE laboratory for 5 levels.
