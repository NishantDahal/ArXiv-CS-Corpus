Protocol for making a $2$-qutrit entangling gate in the Kauffman-Jones version of $SU(2)_4$

The following paper provides a protocol to physically generate a $2$-qutrit entangling gate in the Kauffman-Jones version of $SU(2)$ Chern-Simons theory at level $4$. The protocol uses elementary operations on anyons consisting of braids, interferometric measurements, fusions and unfusions and ancilla pair creation.
