Optimization of OFDM radar waveforms using genetic algorithms

In this paper, we present our investigations on the use of single objective and multiobjective genetic algorithms based optimisation algorithms to improve the design of OFDM pulses for radar. We discuss these optimization procedures in the scope of a waveform design intended for two different radar processing solutions. Lastly, we show how the encoding solution is suited to permit the optimizations of waveform for OFDM radar related challenges such as enhanced detection.
