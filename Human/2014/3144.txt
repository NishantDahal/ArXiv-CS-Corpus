Decentralized Subspace Pursuit for Joint Sparsity Pattern Recovery

To solve the problem of joint sparsity pattern recovery in a decen-tralized network, we propose an algorithm named decentralized and collaborative subspace pursuit (DCSP). The basic idea of DCSP is to embed collaboration among nodes and fusion strategy into each iteration of the standard subspace pursuit (SP) algorithm. In DCSP, each node collaborates with several of its neighbors by sharing high-dimensional coefficient estimates and communicates with other remote nodes by exchanging low-dimensional support set estimates. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with several existing algorithms for sparsity pattern recovery, DCSP produces satisfactory results in terms of accuracy of sparsity pattern recovery with much less communication cost.
