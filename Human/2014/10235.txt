Semantic web service discovery approaches: overview and limitations

The semantic Web service discovery has been given massive attention within the last few years. With the increasing number of Web services available on the web, looking for a particular service has become very difficult, especially with the evolution of the clients needs. In this context, various approaches to discover semantic Web services have been proposed. In this paper, we compare these approaches in order to assess their maturity and their adaptation to the current domain requirements. The outcome of this comparison will help us to identify the mechanisms that constitute the strengths of the existing approaches, and thereafter will serve as guideline to determine the basis for a discovery approach more adapted to the current context of Web services.
