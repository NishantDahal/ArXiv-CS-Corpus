Application of lattice reduction block Korkin-Zolotarev method to MIMO-decoding

This article present a application of Block Korkin---Zolotarev lattice reduction method for Lattice Reduction---Aided decoding under MIMO---channel. We give a upper bound estimate on the lattice reduced by block Korkin---Zolotarev method (BKZ) for different value of the block size and detecting by SIC.
