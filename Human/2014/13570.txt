The simplified weighted sum function and its average sensitivity

In this paper we simplify the definition of the weighted sum Boolean function which used to be inconvenient to compute and use. We show that the new function has essentially the same properties as the previous one. In particular, the bound on the average sensitivity of the weighted sum Boolean function remains unchanged after the simplification.
