A Genetic Algorithm to Optimize a Tweet for Retweetability

Twitter is a popular microblogging platform. When users send out messages, other users have the ability to forward these messages to their own subgraph. Most research focuses on increasing retweetability from a node's perspective. Here, we center on improving message style to increase the chance of a message being forwarded. To this end, we simulate an artificial Twitter-like network with nodes deciding deterministically on retweeting a message or not. A genetic algorithm is used to optimize message composition, so that the reach of a message is increased. When analyzing the algorithm's runtime behavior across a set of different node types, we find that the algorithm consistently succeeds in significantly improving the retweetability of a message.
