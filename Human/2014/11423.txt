Risk Assessment Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks using Beta Distribution

This paper introduces the Beta distribution as a novel technique to weight direct and indirect trust and assessing the risk in wireless sensor networks. This paper also reviews the trust factors, which play a major role in building trust in wireless sensor networks and explains the dynamic aspects of trust. This is an extension of a previous work done by the authors using a new approach to assess risk. Simulation results related to the previous work and to the new approach introduced in this paper are also presented for easy comparison.
