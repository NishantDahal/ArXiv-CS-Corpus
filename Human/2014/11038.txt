Applying Agile Requirements Engineering Approach for Re-engineering & Changes in existing Brownfield Adaptive Systems

Requirements Engineering (RE) is a key activity in the development of software systems and is concerned with the identification of the goals of stakeholders and their elaboration into precise statements of desired services and behavior. The research describes an Agile Requirements Engineering approach for re-engineering & changes in existing Brownfield adaptive system. The approach has few modifications that can be used as a part of SCRUM development process for re-engineering & changes. The approach illustrates the re-engineering & changes requirements through introduction of GAP analysis & requirements structuring & prioritization by creating AS-IS & TO-BE models with 80 / 20 rule. An attempt to close the gap between requirements engineering & agile methods in form of this approach is provided for practical implementation.
