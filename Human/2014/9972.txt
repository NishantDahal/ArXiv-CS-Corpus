Attributes for Causal Inference in Longitudinal Observational Databases

The pharmaceutical industry is plagued by the problem of side effects that can occur anytime a prescribed medication is ingested. There has been a recent interest in using the vast quantities of medical data available in longitudinal observational databases to identify causal relationships between drugs and medical events. Unfortunately the majority of existing post marketing surveillance algorithms measure how dependant or associated an event is on the presence of a drug rather than measuring causality. In this paper we investigate potential attributes that can be used in causal inference to identify side effects based on the Bradford-Hill causality criteria. Potential attributes are developed by considering five of the causality criteria and feature selection is applied to identify the most suitable of these attributes for detecting side effects. We found that attributes based on the specificity criterion may improve side effect signalling algorithms but the experiment and dosage criteria attributes investigated in this paper did not offer sufficient additional information.
