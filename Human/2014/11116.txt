Replacing the computer mouse

In a few months the computer mouse will be half-a-century-old. It is known to have many drawbacks, the main ones being: loss of productivity due to constant switching between keyboard and mouse, and health issues such as RSI. Like the keyboard, it is an unnatural human-computer interface. However the vast majority of computer users still use computer mice nowadays.
  In this article, we explore computer mouse alternatives. Our research shows that moving the mouse cursor can be done efficiently with camera-based head tracking system such as the SmartNav device, and mouse clicks can be emulated in many complementary ways. We believe that computer users can increase their productivity and improve their long-term health by using these alternatives.
