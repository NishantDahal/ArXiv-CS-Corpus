Is a `Wirikuta empowerment' of the Huichol measurable on the Internet?

Current social and activist movements find the opportunity in social media to effectively impact on the agenda of governing bodies and create `global' perceptions -- it is often claimed. Content related to the social and activist movements is online, to be accessed, supported or disputed and distributed from virtually anywhere at any time, in the public sphere of the Internet. This activity allows the enlargement of social movements and would increase the empowerment in the concerned communities. The aim of this explorative study is to assess whether the temporal evolution of the Normalised Web Distance (NWD) --as defined by Cilibrasi & Vit√°nyi (2007)-- between identifying terms concerning this activism could be used to measure the progress or decline of social empowerment through the Internet. The NWD relies on the page count number of single and joint queries, which in our study have been registered using a freely available web browser (e.g. Google Search) providing a time search window for temporal query results. To explore this meta-data technique, we introduce the case of a perceived Wirikuta online movement, which originated in Mexico with the aim to protect the Huichols' sacred land and water resources from open mining projects for silver ore. We conducted a small scale Internet study relating the key terms `Wirikuta', `Huichol', and `Wixarika' and their co-occurrence with seven positive qualifiers (e.g. `sacred land'), five negative qualifiers (e.g. `violence') and one neutral qualifier (`table') over time, annually from 1994 till 2013. We confirm close semantic clustering over time of traditional indigeneous identity terms of the Huichol, and observe a slight convergence of key terms to `mines' and less pronounced to `sacred land' and a divergence with respect to `ancestors' indicating a complex image of a tendency of empowerment.
