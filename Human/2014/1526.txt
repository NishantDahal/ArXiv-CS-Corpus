Filter Bank Multicarrier for Massive MIMO

This paper introduces filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) as a potential candidate in the application of massive MIMO communication. It also points out the advantages of FBMC over OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) in the application of massive MIMO. The absence of cyclic prefix in FBMC increases the bandwidth efficiency. In addition, FBMC allows carrier aggregation straightforwardly. Self-equalization, a property of FBMC in massive MIMO that is introduced in this paper, has the impact of reducing (i) complexity; (ii) sensitivity to carrier frequency offset (CFO); (iii) peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR); (iv) system latency; and (v) increasing bandwidth efficiency. The numerical results that corroborate these claims are presented.
