Recycling Proof Patterns in Coq: Case Studies

Development of Interactive Theorem Provers has led to the creation of big libraries and varied infrastructures for formal proofs. However, despite (or perhaps due to) their sophistication, the re-use of libraries by non-experts or across domains is a challenge. In this paper, we provide detailed case studies and evaluate the machine-learning tool ML4PG built to interactively data-mine the electronic libraries of proofs, and to provide user guidance on the basis of proof patterns found in the existing libraries.
