Orthogonal Matrix in Cryptography

In this work is proposed a method using orthogonal matrix transform properties to encrypt and decrypt a message. It will be showed how to use matrix functions to create complex encryptions. Because orthogonal matrix are always diagonalizable on R, and the exponential of a diagonal matrix is easy to compute, the exponential of orthogonal matrix will be used to encrypt text messages.
