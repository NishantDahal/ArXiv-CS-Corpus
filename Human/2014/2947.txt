Performance Comparison of Two Clipping Based Filtering Methods for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Signal

The growth of wireless communication technologies has been producing the intense demand for high-speed, efficient, reliable voice & data communication. As a result, third generation partnership project (3GPP) has implemented next generation wireless communication technology long term evolution (LTE) which is designed to increase the capacity and speed of existing mobile telephone & data networks. LTE has adopted a multicarrier transmission technique known as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM meets the LTE requirement for spectrum flexibility and enables cost-efficient solutions for very wide carriers. One major generic problem of OFDM technique is high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) which is defined as the ratio of the peak power to the average power of the OFDM signal. A trade-off is necessary for reducing PAPR with increasing bit error rate (BER), computational complexity or data rate loss etc. In this paper, two clipping based filtering methods have been implemented & also analyzed their modulation effects on reducing PAPR.
