Clinical TempEval

We describe the Clinical TempEval task which is currently in preparation for the SemEval-2015 evaluation exercise. This task involves identifying and describing events, times and the relations between them in clinical text. Six discrete subtasks are included, focusing on recognising mentions of times and events, describing those mentions for both entity types, identifying the relation between an event and the document creation time, and identifying narrative container relations.
