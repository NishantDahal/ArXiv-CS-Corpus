Polyadic Constacyclic Codes

For any given positive integer $m$, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of Type I $m$-adic constacyclic codes is given. Further, for any given integer $s$, a necessary and sufficient condition for $s$ to be a multiplier of a Type I polyadic constacyclic code is given. As an application, some optimal codes from Type I polyadic constacyclic codes, including generalized Reed-Solomon codes and alternant MDS codes, are constructed.
