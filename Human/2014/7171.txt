Undecidable properties of self-affine sets and multi-tape automata

We study the decidability of the topological properties of some objects coming from fractal geometry. We prove that having empty interior is undecidable for the sets defined by two-dimensional graph-directed iterated function systems. These results are obtained by studying a particular class of self-affine sets associated with multi-tape automata. We first establish the undecidability of some language-theoretical properties of such automata, which then translate into undecidability results about their associated self-affine sets.
