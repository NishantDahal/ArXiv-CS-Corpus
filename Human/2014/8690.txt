Timed Runtime Monitoring for Multiparty Conversations

We propose a dynamic verification framework for protocols in real-time distributed systems.  The framework is based on Scribble, a tool-chain for design and verification of choreographies based on multiparty session types,   developed with our industrial partners. Drawing from recent work on multiparty session types for real-time interactions,  we extend Scribble with clocks, resets, and clock predicates constraining the times in which interactions should occur. We present a timed API for Python to program distributed implementations of Scribble specifications. A dynamic verification framework ensures the safe execution of applications written with our timed API: we have implemented dedicated runtime monitors that check that each interaction occurs at a correct timing with respect to the corresponding Scribble specification.  The performance of our implementation and its practicability are analysed via benchmarking.
