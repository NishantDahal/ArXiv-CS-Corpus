Source and Channel Optimal Rate LDPC Code Design for one Sender in BE-MAC with Source Correlation

In this paper, we present an extension of the semidefinite programming formulation of the optimal rate code design in single link Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) proposed by the authors to the Binary Erasure Multiple Access Channel (BE-MAC) with two sources correlation. This new way can be easily extended to the multiple access senders. Simulation results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the new approach in practice.
