Systematic Codes for Rank Modulation

The goal of this paper is to construct systematic error-correcting codes for permutations and multi-permutations in the Kendall's $Ï„$-metric. These codes are important in new applications such as rank modulation for flash memories. The construction is based on error-correcting codes for multi-permutations and a partition of the set of permutations into error-correcting codes. For a given large enough number of information symbols $k$, and for any integer $t$, we present a construction for ${(k+r,k)}$ systematic $t$-error-correcting codes, for permutations from $S_{k+r}$, with less redundancy symbols than the number of redundancy symbols in the codes of the known constructions. In particular, for a given $t$ and for sufficiently large $k$ we can obtain $r=t+1$. The same construction is also applied to obtain related systematic error-correcting codes for multi-permutations.
