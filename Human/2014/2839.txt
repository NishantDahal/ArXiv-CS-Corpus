Maximally Permissive Coordination Supervisory Control -- Towards Necessary and Sufficient Conditions

In this paper, we further develop the coordination control framework for discrete-event systems with both complete and partial observation. A new weaker sufficient condition for the computation of the supremal conditionally controllable sublanguage is presented. This result is then used for the computation of the supremal conditionally controllable and conditionally normal sublanguage. The paper further generalizes the previous study by considering general, non-prefix-closed languages.
