Gossip-based Information Spreading in Mobile Networks

Mobile networks receive increasing research interest recently due to their increasingly wide applications in various areas; mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) and Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) are two prominent examples. Mobility introduces challenges as well as opportunities: it is known to improve the network throughput as shown in [1]. In this paper, we analyze the effect of mobility on the information spreading based on gossip algorithms. Our contributions are twofold. Firstly, we propose a new performance metric, mobile conductance, which allows us to separate the details of mobility models from the study of mobile spreading time. Secondly, we explore the mobile conductances of several popular mobility models, and offer insights on the corresponding results. Large scale network simulation is conducted to verify our analysis.
