A Galois-Connection between Myers-Briggs' Type Indicators and Szondi's Personality Profiles

We propose a computable Galois-connection between Myers-Briggs' Type Indicators (MBTIs), the most widely-used personality measure for non-psychiatric populations (based on C.G. Jung's personality types), and Szondi's personality profiles (SPPs), a less well-known but, as we show, finer personality measure for psychiatric as well as non-psychiatric populations (conceived as a unification of the depth psychology of S. Freud, C.G. Jung, and A. Adler). The practical significance of our result is that our Galois-connection provides a pair of computable, interpreting translations between the two personality spaces of MBTIs and SPPs: one concrete from MBTI-space to SPP-space (because SPPs are finer) and one abstract from SPP-space to MBTI-space (because MBTIs are coarser). Thus Myers-Briggs' and Szondi's personality-test results are mutually interpretable and inter-translatable, even automatically by computers.
