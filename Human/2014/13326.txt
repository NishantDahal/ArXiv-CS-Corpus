An Upper Bound on the Sizes of Multiset-Union-Free Families

Let $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ be two families of subsets of an $n$-element set. We say that $\mathcal{F}_1$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ are multiset-union-free if for any $A,B\in \mathcal{F}_1$ and $C,D\in \mathcal{F}_2$ the multisets $A\uplus C$ and $B\uplus D$ are different, unless both $A = B$ and $C= D$. We derive a new upper bound on the maximal sizes of multiset-union-free pairs, improving a result of Urbanke and Li.
