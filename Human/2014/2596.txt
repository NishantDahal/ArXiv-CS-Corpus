Proceedings 8th International Workshop on Developments in Computational Models

The aim of the workshop series Developments in Computational Models (DCM) is to bring together researchers who are currently developing new computational models or new features for traditional computational models, in order to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities in this area. The eighth workshop in the series, DCM 2012, was part of the celebrations of the Turing Centenary and was held as a satellite event of the Turing centenary conference Computability in Europe 2012 (CiE 2012) in Cambridge. It took place at Corpus Christi College in Cambridge on Sunday, 17 June 2013.
  This electronic proceedings volume includes one of the keynote papers as well as revised versions of papers accepted for presentation by the programme committee.
