Quantum Information Entropies for the $\ell$-state Pöschl-Teller-type potential

In this study, we obtained the position-momentum uncertainties and some uncertainty relations for the Pöschl-Teller-type potential for any $\ell$. The radial expectation values of $r^{-2}$, $r^{2}$ and $p^{2}$ are obtained from which the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle holds for the potential model under consideration. The Fisher information is then obtained and it is observed that the Fisher-information-based uncertainty relation and the Cramer-Rao inequality hold for this even power potential. Some numerical and graphical results are displayed.
