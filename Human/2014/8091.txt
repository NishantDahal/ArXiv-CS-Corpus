Calibration of Multiple Fish-Eye Cameras Using a Wand

Fish-eye cameras are becoming increasingly popular in computer vision, but their use for 3D measurement is limited partly due to the lack of an accurate, efficient and user-friendly calibration procedure. For such a purpose, we propose a method to calibrate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters (including radial distortion parameters) of two/multiple fish-eye cameras simultaneously by using a wand under general motions. Thanks to the generic camera model used, the proposed calibration method is also suitable for two/multiple conventional cameras and mixed cameras (e.g. two conventional cameras and a fish-eye camera). Simulation and real experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we develop the camera calibration toolbox, which is available online.
