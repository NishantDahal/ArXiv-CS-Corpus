OFDM Transmission Performance Evaluation in V2X Communication

The Vehicle to Vehicle and Vehicle to Infrastructure V2X communication systems are one of the main topics in research domain. Its performance evaluation is an important step before their on board integration into vehicles and its probable real deployment. This paper studies the physical layer PHY of the upcoming vehicular communication standard IEEE 802.11p. This standard PHY Layer model, with much associated phenomena, is implemented in V2V and V2I, situations through different scenarios. The series of simulation results carried out, perform data exchange between high speed vehicles over different channels models and different transmitted packet size. We underline several propagation channel and other important parameters, which affect both the physical layer network performance and the QoT. The Bit Error Rate BER versus Signal to Noise Ratio SNR of all coding rates is used to evaluate the performance of the communication.
