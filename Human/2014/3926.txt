Dynamic and Multi-functional Labeling Schemes

We investigate labeling schemes supporting adjacency, ancestry, sibling, and connectivity queries in forests. In the course of more than 20 years, the existence of $\log n + O(\log \log)$ labeling schemes supporting each of these functions was proven, with the most recent being ancestry [Fraigniaud and Korman, STOC '10]. Several multi-functional labeling schemes also enjoy lower or upper bounds of $\log n + Ω(\log \log n)$ or $\log n + O(\log \log n)$ respectively. Notably an upper bound of $\log n + 5\log \log n$ for adjacency+siblings and a lower bound of $\log n + \log \log n$ for each of the functions siblings, ancestry, and connectivity [Alstrup et al., SODA '03]. We improve the constants hidden in the $O$-notation. In particular we show a $\log n + 2\log \log n$ lower bound for connectivity+ancestry and connectivity+siblings, as well as an upper bound of $\log n + 3\log \log n + O(\log \log \log n)$ for connectivity+adjacency+siblings by altering existing methods.
  In the context of dynamic labeling schemes it is known that ancestry requires $Ω(n)$ bits [Cohen, et al. PODS '02]. In contrast, we show upper and lower bounds on the label size for adjacency, siblings, and connectivity of $2\log n$ bits, and $3 \log n$ to support all three functions. There exist efficient adjacency labeling schemes for planar, bounded treewidth, bounded arboricity and interval graphs. In a dynamic setting, we show a lower bound of $Ω(n)$ for each of those families.
