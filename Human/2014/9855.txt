View-Centric Modeling of Automotive Logical Architectures

Modeling the logical architecture is an often underestimated development step to gain an early insight into the fundamental functional properties of an automotive system. An architectural description supports developers in making design decisions for further development steps like the refinement towards a software architecture or the partition of logical functions on ECUs and buses. However, due to the large size and complexity of the system and hence the logical architecture, a good notation, method, and tooling is necessary. In this paper, we show how the logical architectures can be modeled succinctly as function nets using a SysML-based notation. The usefulness for developers is increased by comprehensible views on the complete model to describe automotive features in a self contained way including their variants, modes, and related scenarios.
