A Hypermedia Distributed Application for Monitoring and Fault-Injection in Embedded Fault-tolerant Parallel Programs

We describe a distributed, multimedia application which is being developed in the framework of the ESPRIT-IV Project 21012 EFTOS (Embedded Fault-Tolerant Supercomputing). The application dynamically sets up a hierarchy of HTML pages reflecting the current status of an EFTOS-compliant dependable application running on a Parsytec CC system. These pages are fed to a World-Wide Web browser playing the role of a hypermedia monitor. The adopted approach allows the user to concentrate on the high-level aspects of his/her application so to quickly assess the quality of its current fault-tolerance design. This view of the system lends itself well for being coupled with a tool to interactively inject software faults in the user application; this tool is currently under development.
