Cooperative Caching based on File Popularity Ranking in Delay Tolerant Networks

Increasing storage sizes and WiFi/Bluetooth capabilities of mobile devices have made them a good platform for opportunistic content sharing. In this work we propose a network model to study this in a setting with two characteristics: 1. delay tolerant; 2. lack of infrastructure. Mobile users generate requests and opportunistically download from other users they meet, via Bluetooth or WiFi. The difference in popularity of different web content induces a non-uniform request distribution, which is usually a Zipf's law distribution. We evaluate the performance of different caching schemes and derive the optimal scheme using convex optimization techniques. The optimal solution is found efficiently using a binary search method. It is shown that as the network mobility increases, the performance of the optimal scheme far exceeds the traditional caching scheme. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to consider popularity ranking in performance evaluation.
