Genetic Algorithm in Audio Steganography

With the advancement of communication technology,data is exchanged digitally over the network. At the other side the technology is also proven as a tool for unauthorized access to attackers. Thus the security of data to be transmitted digitally should get prime focus. Data hiding is the common approach to secure data. In steganography technique, the existence of data is concealed. GA is an emerging component of AI to provide suboptimal solutions. In this paper the use of GA in Steganography is explored to find future scope of research.
