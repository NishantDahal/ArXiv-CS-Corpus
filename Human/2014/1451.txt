Lattice structures for bisimilar Probabilistic Automata

The paper shows that there is a deep structure on certain sets of bisimilar Probabilistic Automata (PA). The key prerequisite for these structures is a notion of compactness of PA. It is shown that compact bisimilar PA form lattices. These results are then used in order to establish normal forms not only for finite automata, but also for infinite automata, as long as they are compact.
