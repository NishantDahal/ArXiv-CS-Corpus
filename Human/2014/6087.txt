A Joint Localization and Clock Bias Estimation Technique Using Time-of-Arrival at Multiple Antenna Receivers

In this work, a system scheme is proposed for tracking a radio emitting target moving in two-dimensional space. The localization is based on the use of biased time-of-arrival (TOA) measurements obtained at two asynchronous receivers, each equipped with two closely spaced antennas. By exploiting the multi-antenna configuration and using all the TOA measurements up to current time step, the relative clock bias at each receiver and the target position are jointly estimated by solving a nonlinear least-squares (NLS) problem. To this end, a novel time recursive algorithm is proposed which fully takes advantage of the problem structure to achieve computational efficiency while using orthogonal transformations to ensure numerical reliability. Simulations show that the mean-squared error (MSE) of the proposed method is much smaller than that of existing methods with the same antenna scheme, and approaches the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) closely.
