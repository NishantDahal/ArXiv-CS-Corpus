Design and Analysis of RS Sort

This paper introduces a new comparison base stable sorting algorithm, named RS sort. RS Sort involves only the comparison of pair of elements in an array which ultimately sorts the array and does not involve the comparison of each element with every other element. RS sort tries to build upon the relationship established between the elements in each pass. Suppose there is an array containing three elements a1, a2, a3 and if a relationship exist such that a1<a2 and a2<a3 then it can be established that a1<a3 and so there is no need to compare a1 and a3. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science. RS sort is analyzed both theoretically and empirically. We have performed its Empirical analysis and compared its performance with the well-known quick sort for various input types.
