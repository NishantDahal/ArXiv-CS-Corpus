One-Way Reversible and Quantum Finite Automata with Advice

We examine the characteristic features of reversible and quantum computations in the presence of supplementary external information, known as advice. In particular, we present a simple, algebraic characterization of languages recognized by one-way reversible finite automata augmented with deterministic advice. With a further elaborate argument, we prove a similar but slightly weaker result for bounded-error one-way quantum finite automata with advice. Immediate applications of those properties lead to containments and separations among various language families when they are assisted by appropriately chosen advice. We further demonstrate the power and limitation of randomized advice and quantum advice when they are given to one-way quantum finite automata.
