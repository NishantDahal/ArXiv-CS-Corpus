Addressing NameNode Scalability Issue in Hadoop Distributed File System using Cache Approach

Hadoop is a distributed batch processing infrastructure which is currently being used for big data management. The foundation of Hadoop consists of Hadoop Distributed File System or HDFS. HDFS presents a client server architecture comprised of a NameNode and many DataNodes. The NameNode stores the metadata for the DataNodes and DataNode stores application data. The NameNode holds file system metadata in memory, and thus the limit to the number of files in a file system is governed by the amount of memory on the NameNode. Thus when the memory on NameNode is full there is no further chance of increasing the cluster capacity. In this paper we have used the concept of cache memory for handling the issue of NameNode scalability. The focus of this paper is to highlight our approach that tries to enhance the current architecture and ensure that NameNode does not reach its threshold value soon.
