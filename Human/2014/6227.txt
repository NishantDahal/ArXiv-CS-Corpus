Intelligent Emergency Message Broadcasting in VANET Using PSO

The new type of Mobile Ad hoc Network which is called Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANET) created a fertile environment for research. In this research, a protocol Particle Swarm Optimization Contention Based Broadcast (PCBB) is proposed, for fast andeffective dissemination of emergency messages within a geographical area to distribute the emergency message and achieve the safety system, this research will help the VANET system to achieve its safety goals in intelligent and efficient way.
