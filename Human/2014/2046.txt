Reconstruction Models for Attractors in the Technical and Economic Processes

The article discusses building models based on the reconstructed attractors of the time series. Discusses the use of the properties of dynamical chaos, namely to identify the strange attractors structure models. Here is used the group properties of differential equations, which consist in the symmetry of particular solutions. Examples of modeling engineering systems are given.
