From Unbalanced Initial Occupant Distribution to Balanced Exit Usage in a Simulation Model of Pedestrian Dynamics

It is tested in this contribution if and to which extend a method of a pedestrian simulation tool that attempts to make pedestrians walk into the direction of estimated earliest arrival can help to automatically distribute pedestrians - who are initially distributed arbitrarily in the scenario - equally on the various exits of the scenario.
