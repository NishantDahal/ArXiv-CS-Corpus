Pirus: A Web-based File Hosting Service with Object Oriented Logic in Cloud Computing

In this paper a new Web-based File Hosting Service with Object Oriented Logic in Cloud Computing called Pirus was developed. The service will be used by the academic community of the University of Piraeus giving users the ability to remotely store and access their personal files with no security compromises. It also offers the administrators the ability to manage users and roles. The objective was to deliver a fully operational service, using state-of-the-art programming techniques to enable scalability and future development of the existing functionality. The use of technologies such as .NET Framework, C# programming language, CSS and jQuery, MSSQL for database hosting and the support of Virtualization and Cloud Computing will contribute significantly in compatibility, code reuse, reliability and reduce of maintenance costs and resources. The service was installed and tested in a controlled environment to ascertain the required functionality and the offered reliability and safety with complete success.
  The technologies used and supported, allow future work in upgrading and extending the service. Changes and improvements, in hardware and software, in order to convert the service to a SaaS (Software as a Service) Cloud application is a logical step in order to efficiently offer the service to a wider community. Improved and added functionality offered by further development will leverage the user experience.
