Towards a Pattern-based Automatic Generation of Logical Specifications for Software Models

The work relates to the automatic generation of logical specifications, considered as sets of temporal logic formulas, extracted directly from developed software models. The extraction process is based on the assumption that the whole developed model is structured using only predefined workflow patterns. A method of automatic transformation of workflow patterns to logical specifications is proposed. Applying the presented concepts enables bridging the gap between the benefits of deductive reasoning for the correctness verification process and the difficulties in obtaining complete logical specifications for this process.
