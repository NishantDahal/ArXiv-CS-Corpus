Optimal sequence for Parrondo games

An algorithm based on backward induction is devised in order to compute the optimal sequence of games to be played in Parrondo games. The algorithm can be used to find the optimal sequence for any finite number of turns or in the steady state, showing that ABABB... is the sequence with the highest steady state average gain. The algorithm can also be generalised to find the optimal adaptive strategy in a multi-player version of the games, where a finite number of players may choose, at every turn, the game the whole ensemble should play.
