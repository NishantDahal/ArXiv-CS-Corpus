On generalization of reversible second-order cellular automata

A cellular automaton with $n$ states may be used for construction of reversible second-order cellular automaton with $n^2$ states. Reversible cellular automata with hidden parameters discussed in this paper are generalization of such construction and may have number of states $N=n m$ with arbitrary $m$. Further modification produces reversible cellular automata with reduced number of states $N' < N = n m$.
