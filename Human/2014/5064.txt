Ancilla-Quantum Cost Trade-off during Reversible Logic Synthesis using Exclusive Sum-of-Products

Emerging technologies with asymptotic zero power dissipation, such as quantum computing, require the logical operations to be done in a reversible manner. In recent years, the problem of synthesizing Boolean functions in the reversible logic domain has gained significant research attention. The efficiency of the synthesis methods is measured in terms of quantum cost, gate cost, garbage lines, logic depth and speed of synthesis. In this paper, we present an approach based on Exclusive sum-of-Products (ESOP), which allows the user to explore the trade-off between quantum cost and garbage lines. The proposed technique adds a new dimension to the reversible logic synthesis solutions. We demonstrate by detailed experiments that controlled improvement in quantum cost and gate count by increasing garbage count can be achieved. In some cases, improved quantum cost and gate count compared to state-of-the-art synthesis methods are reported. Furthermore, we propose a novel rule-based approach to achieve ancilla-free reversible logic synthesis starting from an ESOP formulation.
