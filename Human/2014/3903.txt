InfluenceTracker: Rating the impact of a Twitter account

We describe a methodology of rating the influence of a Twitter ac-count in this famous microblogging service. We then evaluate it over real ac-counts, under the belief that influence is not only a matter of quantity (amount of followers), but also a mixture of quality measures that reflect interaction, awareness, and visibility in the social sphere. The authors of this paper have created InfluenceTracker, a publicly available website where anyone can rate and compare the recent activity of any Twitter account.
