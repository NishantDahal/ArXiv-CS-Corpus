Effect of Receptor Density and Size on Signal Reception in Molecular Communication via Diffusion with an Absorbing Receiver

The performance of molecular communication is significantly impacted by the reception process of the messenger molecules. The receptors' size and density, however, have yet to be investigated. In this letter, we analyze the effect of receptor density and size on the signal reception of an absorbing receiver with receptors. The results show that, when the total receptor area is the same, better hitting probability is achieved by using a higher number of relatively small receptors. In addition, deploying receptors, which cover a small percentage of the receiver surface, is able to create an effective communication channel that has a detectable signal level.
