Security issues for data sharing and service interoperability in eHealth systems: the Nu.Sa. test bed

The aim of the Nu.Sa. project is the definition of national level data standards to collect data coming from General Practitioners' Electronic Health Records and to allow secure data sharing between them. This paper introduces the Nu.Sa. framework and is mainly focused on security issues. A solution for secure data sharing and service interoperability is presented and implemented in the actual system used around Italy. The solution is strongly focused on privacy and correct data sharing with a complete set of tools devoted to authorization, encryption and decryption in a data sharing environment and a distributed architecture. The implemented system with more than one year of experiences in thousands of test cases shows a good feasibility of the approach and a future scalability in a cloud based architecture.
