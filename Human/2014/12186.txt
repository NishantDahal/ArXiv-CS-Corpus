A Tag Identification Approach Based On Fragile Watermark

This paper proposes a tag identify approach based on fragile Watermark that based on Least significant bit of the replacement that we first use a special way to initialize the cover to ensure that we can use random positions to embed the information of tag. Using this way enhance the security of other to get the right information of this tag. Finally as long as the covered information can be decoded, the completeness and accuracy of the tag information can be guaranteed. the result of simulation experiment show that this approach has high sensitivity and security .
