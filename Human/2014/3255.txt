Design and Performance Evaluation of an Optimized Disk Scheduling Algorithm (ODSA)

Management of disk scheduling is a very important aspect of operating system. Performance of the disk scheduling completely depends on how efficient is the scheduling algorithm to allocate services to the request in a better manner. Many algorithms (FIFO, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, etc.) are developed in the recent years in order to optimize the system disk I/O performance. By reducing the average seek time and transfer time, we can improve the performance of disk I/O operation. In our proposed algorithm, Optimize Disk Scheduling Algorithm (ODSA) is taking less average seek time and transfer time as compare to other disk scheduling algorithms (FIFO, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, etc.), which enhances the efficiency of the disk performance in a better manner.
