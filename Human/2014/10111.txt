On the optimality of shape and data representation in the spectral domain

A proof of the optimality of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (LBO)   in representing smooth functions on surfaces is provided and adapted to the   field of applied shape and data analysis. It is based on the Courant-Fischer min-max principle adapted to our case. % The theorem we present supports the new trend in geometry processing of   treating geometric structures by using their projection onto the leading eigenfunctions   of the decomposition of the LBO. Utilisation of this result can be used for constructing numerically efficient algorithms   to process shapes in their spectrum. We review a couple of applications as possible practical usage cases   of the proposed optimality criteria. % We refer to a scale invariant metric, which is also invariant to bending of the manifold. This novel pseudo-metric allows constructing an LBO by which a scale   invariant eigenspace on the surface is defined. We demonstrate the efficiency of an intermediate metric, defined as an interpolation   between the scale invariant and the regular one, in representing geometric   structures while capturing both coarse and fine details. Next, we review a numerical acceleration technique for classical scaling, a member   of a family of flattening methods known as multidimensional scaling (MDS). There, the optimality is exploited   to efficiently approximate all geodesic distances between pairs of points on a given   surface, and thereby match and compare between almost isometric surfaces. Finally, we revisit the classical principal component analysis (PCA) definition   by coupling its variational form with a Dirichlet energy on the data manifold. By pairing the PCA with the LBO we can handle cases that go beyond the   scope defined by the observation set that is handled by regular PCA.
