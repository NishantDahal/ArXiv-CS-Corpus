Sets, the Axiom of Choice, And All That: A Tutorial

This tutorial deal with the Axiom of Choice and some of its applications to topics related to Computer Science. We will see that the Axiom of Choice is equivalent to some well-known proof principles like Zorn's Lemma or Tuckey's Maximality Principle. We try to touch upon some topics, which appear to be important for developing mathematical structures within computer science.
