Diversity Multiplexing Tradeoff of the Half-duplex Slow Fading Multiple Access Channel based on Generalized Quantize-and-Forward Scheme

This paper investigates the Diversity Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT) of the generalized quantize-and-forward (GQF) relaying scheme over the slow fading half-duplex multiple-access relay channel (HD-MARC). The compress-and-forward (CF) scheme has been shown to achieve the optimal DMT when the channel state information (CSI) of the relay-destination link is available at the relay. However, having the CSI of relay-destination link at relay is not always possible due to the practical considerations of the wireless system. In contrast, in this work, the DMT of the GQF scheme is derived without relay-destination link CSI at the relay. It is shown that even without knowledge of relay-destination CSI, the GQF scheme achieves the same DMT, achievable by CF scheme with full knowledge of CSI.
