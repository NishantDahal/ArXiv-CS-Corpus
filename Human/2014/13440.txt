Toward Refactoring of DMARF and GIPSY Case Studies -- a Team 9 SOEN6471-S14 Project Report

Software architecture consists of series of decisions taken to give a structural solution that meets all the technical and operational requirements. The paper involves code refactoring. Code refactoring is a process of changing the internal structure of the code without altering its external behavior. This paper focuses over open source systems experimental studies that are DMARF and GIPSY. We have gone through various research papers and analyzed their architectures. Refactoring improves understandability, maintainability, extensibility of the code. Code smells were identified through various tools such as JDeodorant, Logiscope, and CodePro. Reverse engineering of DMARF and GIPSY were done for understanding the system. Tool used for this was Object Aid UML. For better understanding use cases, domain model, design class diagram are built.
