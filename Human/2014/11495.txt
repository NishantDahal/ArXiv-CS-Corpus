Cross-Layer Control for Worse Case Delay Guarantees in Heterogeneous Powered Wireless Sensor Network via Lyapunov Optimization

The delay guarantee is a challenge in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), where energy constraints must be considered. The coexistence of renewable energy and electricity grid is expected as a promising energy supply manner for WSNs to remain function for a potentially infinite lifetime. In this paper, we address cross-layer control to guarantee worse case delay for Heterogeneous Powered (HP) WSNs. We design a novel virtual delay queue structure, and apply the Lyapunov optimization technique to develop cross-layer control algorithm only requiring knowledge of the instantaneous system state, which provides efficient throughput-utility, and guarantees bounded worst-case delay. We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm and verify the theoretic claims through the simulation results. Compared to the existing work, the algorithm presented in this paper achieves much higher optimal objective value with ultralow data drop due to the proposed novel virtual queue structure.
