Proceedings 5th Workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming

This volume contains the proceedings of the Fifth Workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming (MSFP 2014), taking place on 12 April, 2014 in Grenoble, France, as a satellite event of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software, ETAPS 2014.
  MSFP is devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It highlights concepts from algebra, semantics and type theory as they are increasingly reflected in programming practice, especially functional programming. As the range of papers presented in this year's workshop shows, this continues to be a fruitful interface.
