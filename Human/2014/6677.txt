A Modified Design of ACF Operation for Reducing PAPR of OFDM Signal

Next generation wireless communication technology long term evolution (LTE) has implemented orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique as a strong candidate for radio access systems. It has several attributes such as providing robustness to multipath fading & impulse noise, eliminating intersymbol interference (ISI), inter carrier interference (ICI) & the need for equalizers. The major challenging issue of OFDM technique is the high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) which is defined as the ratio of the peak power to the average power of the OFDM signal. A trade-off is necessary for reducing PAPR with increasing bit error rate (BER), computational complexity or data rate loss etc. In this paper, a moderately modified design of amplitude clipping & filtering operation (ACF) is proposed and implemented which shows the significant improvement in case of PAPR reduction for both quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) & quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) while increasing slight BER match up to to an existing method.
