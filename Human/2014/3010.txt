Web-based Database Management to support Telemedicine System

The transfer of the medical care services to the patient, rather than the transport of the patient to the medical services providers is aim of the project. This is achieved by using web-based applications including Modern Medical Informatics Services which is easier, faster and less expensive. The required system implements the suitable informatics and electronics solutions efficiently for the Tele-medicine care. We proposed an approach to manage different multimedia medical databases in the telemedicine system. In order to be efficiently and effectively manage, search, and display database information, we define an information package for both of doctor and patient as a concise data set of their medical information from each visit. The methodology for accessing various types of medical records will be provided, also we will design two web-based interfaces, high-quality data and display for many medical service purposes.
