Freedom From Restriction, Freedom Of A Restriction: A Comparison Of Some Open Source Software Licenses

There is a multitude of licenses out there for a software developer to choose from, but a lot of programmers would prefer to not have to have a legal degree in order to understand them and would rather just have their code out in the public being used.

This paper attempts to clarify which license a developer would benefit from the most if they just want to have their code used, have their name out there and not be sued if anything breaks.
