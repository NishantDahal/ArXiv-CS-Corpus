Node Repair for Distributed Storage Systems over Fading Channels

Distributed storage systems and associated storage codes can efficiently store a large amount of data while ensuring that data is retrievable in case of node failure. The study of such systems, particularly the design of storage codes over finite fields, assumes that the physical channel through which the nodes communicate is error-free. This is not always the case, for example, in a wireless storage system.
  We study the probability that a subpacket is repaired incorrectly during node repair in a distributed storage system, in which the nodes communicate over an AWGN or Rayleigh fading channels. The asymptotic probability (as SNR increases) that a node is repaired incorrectly is shown to be completely determined by the repair locality of the DSS and the symbol error rate of the wireless channel. Lastly, we propose some design criteria for physical layer coding in this scenario, and use it to compute optimally rotated QAM constellations for use in wireless distributed storage systems.
