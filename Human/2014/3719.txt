Practical Experience Report: The Performance of Paxos in the Cloud

This experience report presents the results of an extensive performance evaluation conducted using four open-source implementations of Paxos deployed in Amazon's EC2. Paxos is a fundamental algorithm for building fault-tolerant services, at the core of state-machine replication. Implementations of Paxos are currently used in many prototypes and production systems in both academia and industry. Although all protocols surveyed in the paper implement Paxos, they are optimized in a number of different ways, resulting in very different behavior, as we show in the paper. We have considered a variety of configurations and failure-free and faulty executions. In addition to reporting our findings, we propose and assess additional optimizations to existing implementations.
