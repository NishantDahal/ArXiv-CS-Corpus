Substitute Based SCODE Word Embeddings in Supervised NLP Tasks

We analyze a word embedding method in supervised tasks. It maps words on a sphere such that words co-occurring in similar contexts lie closely. The similarity of contexts is measured by the distribution of substitutes that can fill them. We compared word embeddings, including more recent representations, in Named Entity Recognition (NER), Chunking, and Dependency Parsing. We examine our framework in multilingual dependency parsing as well. The results show that the proposed method achieves as good as or better results compared to the other word embeddings in the tasks we investigate. It achieves state-of-the-art results in multilingual dependency parsing. Word embeddings in 7 languages are available for public use.
