Analysis, classification and detection methods of attacks via wireless sensor networks in SCADA systems

Effectiveness of information security of automated process control systems, as well as of SCADA, depends on data transmissions protection technologies applied on transport environments components. This article investigates the problem of detecting attacks on WSN (wireless sensor networks) of SCADA systems. As the result of analytical studies the authors developed the detailed classification of external attacks on sensor networks and brought the detailed description of attacking impacts on components of SCADA systems in accordance with selected directions of attacks. Reviewed the methods of intrusion detection in wireless sensor networks of SCADA systems and functions of WIDS (wireless intrusion detection systems). Noticed the role of anthropogenic factors in internal security threats.
