Understanding the impact of socialbot attacks in online social networks

Online social networks (OSN) like Twitter or Facebook are popular and powerful since they allow reaching millions of users online. They are also a popular target for socialbot attacks. Without a deep understanding of the impact of such attacks, the potential of online social networks as an instrument for facilitating discourse or democratic processes is in jeopardy. In this extended abstract we present insights from a live lab experiment in which social bots aimed at manipulating the social graph of an online social network, in our case Twitter. We explored the link creation behavior between targeted human users and our results suggest that socialbots may indeed have the ability to shape and influence the social graph in online social networks. However, our results also show that external factors may play an important role in the creation of social links in OSNs.
