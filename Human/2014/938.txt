Analyzing an Analytical Solution Model for Simultaneous Mobility

Current mobility models for simultaneous mobility have their convolution in designing simultaneous movement where mobile nodes (MNs) travel randomly from the two adjacent cells at the same time and also have their complexity in the measurement of the occurrences of simultaneous handover. Simultaneous mobility problem incurs when two of the MNs start handover approximately at the same time. As Simultaneous mobility is different for the other mobility pattern, generally occurs less number of times in real time; we analyze that a simplified simultaneous mobility model can be considered by taking only symmetric positions of MNs with random steps. In addition to that, we simulated the model using mSCTP and compare the simulation results in different scenarios with customized cell ranges. The analytical results shows that with the bigger the cell sizes, simultaneous handover with random steps occurrences become lees and for the sequential mobility (where initial positions of MNs is predetermined) with random steps, simultaneous handover is more frequent.
