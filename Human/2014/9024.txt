Supporting SPARQL Update Queries in RDF-XML Integration

The Web of Data encourages organizations and companies to publish their data according to the Linked Data practices and offer SPARQL endpoints. On the other hand, the dominant standard for information exchange is XML. The SPARQL2XQuery Framework focuses on the automatic translation of SPARQL queries in XQuery expressions in order to access XML data across the Web. In this paper, we outline our ongoing work on supporting update queries in the RDF-XML integration scenario.
