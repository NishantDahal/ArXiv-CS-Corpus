Spectral Experiments+

We describe extensive computational experiments on spectral properties of random objects - random cubic graphs, random planar triangulations, and Voronoi and Delaunay diagrams of random (uniformly distributed) point sets on the sphere). We look at bulk eigenvalue distribution, eigenvalue spacings, and locality properties of eigenvectors. We also look at the statistics of \emph{nodal domains} of eigenvectors on these graphs. In all cases we discover completely new (at least to this author) phenomena. The author has tried to refrain from making specific conjectures, inviting the reader, instead, to meditate on the data.
