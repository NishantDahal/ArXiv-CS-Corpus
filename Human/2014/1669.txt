Cyber Behavior of Microblog Users: Onlies Versus Others

Much research has been conducted to investigate personality and daily behavior of these only children ('Onlies') due to the Chinese one-child-per-family policy, and report the singleton generation to be more selfish. As Microblog becomes increasingly popular recently in China, we studied cyber behavior of Onlies and children with siblings ('Others') on Sina Microblog ('Weibo'), a leading Microblog service provider in China. Participants were 1792 Weibo users. Their recorded data on Weibo were downloaded to assess their cyber behaviors. The general results show that (1) Onlies have a smaller social circle; (2)Onlies are more significantly active on social platform.
