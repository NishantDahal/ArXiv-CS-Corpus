E-BLOW: E-Beam Lithography Overlapping aware Stencil Planning for MCC System

Electron beam lithography (EBL) is a promising maskless solution for the technology beyond 14nm logic node. To overcome its throughput limitation, recently the traditional EBL system is extended into MCC system. %to further improve the throughput. In this paper, we present E-BLOW, a tool to solve the overlapping aware stencil planning (OSP) problems in MCC system. E-BLOW is integrated with several novel speedup techniques, i.e., successive relaxation, dynamic programming and KD-Tree based clustering, to achieve a good performance in terms of runtime and solution quality. Experimental results show that, compared with previous works, E-BLOW demonstrates better performance for both conventional EBL system and MCC system.
