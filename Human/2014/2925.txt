Threshold Analysis of Non-Binary Spatially-Coupled LDPC Codes with Windowed Decoding

In this paper we study the iterative decoding threshold performance of non-binary spatially-coupled low-density parity-check (NB-SC-LDPC) code ensembles for both the binary erasure channel (BEC) and the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGNC), with particular emphasis on windowed decoding (WD). We consider both (2,4)-regular and (3,6)-regular NB-SC-LDPC code ensembles constructed using protographs and compute their thresholds using protograph versions of NB density evolution and NB extrinsic information transfer analysis. For these code ensembles, we show that WD of NB-SC-LDPC codes, which provides a significant decrease in latency and complexity compared to decoding across the entire parity-check matrix, results in a negligible decrease in the near-capacity performance for a sufficiently large window size W on both the BEC and the BIAWGNC. Also, we show that NB-SC-LDPC code ensembles exhibit gains in the WD threshold compared to the corresponding block code ensembles decoded across the entire parity-check matrix, and that the gains increase as the finite field size q increases. Moreover, from the viewpoint of decoding complexity, we see that (3,6)-regular NB-SC-LDPC codes are particularly attractive due to the fact that they achieve near-capacity thresholds even for small q and W.
