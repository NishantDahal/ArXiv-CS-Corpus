Hankel Determinant Solution for Elliptic Sequence

We show that the Hankel determinants of a generalized Catalan sequence satisfy the equations of the elliptic sequence. As a consequence, the coordinates of the multiples of an arbitrary point on the elliptic curve are expressed by the Hankel determinants.
