School of the future: smartphones as a laboratory in pocket of each student

The idea to unite student smartphones in a scalable network and use the network to collect data of personal environmental sensors and health indicators is proposed. Access to the sensors, which are available in every smartphone will provide the appropriate software. Such a monitoring at the global level would reveal the impact of the electromagnetic radiation, environmental pollution and weather factors on human health. Participation in these measurements increases the educational and social activity of students. [in Ukrainian]
