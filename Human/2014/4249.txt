A Novel Anonymous Cloud Architecture Design; Providing Secure Online Services and Electronic Payments

Anonymous cloud architecture provides secure environment for business and also e-commerce approaches. By using this type of architecture, we can propose anonymous online applications. Customers who need secure and reliable online services should pay for provided services. A big problem is electronic payment that is needed for billing customers. But customer identity should be remained anonymous during and also after payment procedure. In this paper we propose a novel and modified anonymous architecture that ensures customers that hide their identity from others. This architecture is used from common network protocols and we eliminate Tor anonymous service from architecture design space because of independency. The here is introduced scalability parameter in anonymous cloud architecture design space. After all we compare proposed architecture with other popular cloud architectures in this range and we obtain its advantages according to efficiency, security and anonymity.
