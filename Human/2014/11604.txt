Computer-mediated communication in adults with high-functioning Autism Spectrum Conditions

It has been suggested that people with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are attracted to computer-mediated communication (CMC). In this study, several open questions regarding CMC use in people with ASC which are investigated. We compare CMC use in adults with high-functioning ASC (N = 113) and a control group (N = 72). We find that people with ASC (1) spend more time on CMC than controls, (2) are more positive about CMC, (3) report relatively high levels of online social life satisfaction, and that (4) CMC use is negatively related to satisfaction with life for people with ASC. Our results indicate that the ASC subjects in this study use CMC at least as enthusiastically as controls, and are proficient and successful in its use.
