Analysis of the Frequency Offset Effect on Zadoff-Chu Sequence Timing Performance

Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences have been used as synchronization sequences in modern wireless communication systems, replacing the conventional pseudo-random noise (PN) sequences due to their perfect autocorrelation properties. We first study the ambiguity problem between a timing offset and a frequency offset when a ZC sequence is used as a synchronization signal. We show how a frequency offset can impair the timing property of a ZC sequence, causing irreducible timing errors. An analytical framework is developed, which completely characterizes a ZC sequence's timing behavior and its fundamental limitation as a synchronization sequence in the presence of a frequency offset between the transmitter and the receiver.
