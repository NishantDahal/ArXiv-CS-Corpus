Hiding Sound in Image by K-LSB Mutation

In this paper a novel approach to hide sound files in a digital image is proposed and implemented such that it becomes difficult to conclude about the existence of the hidden data inside the image. In this approach, we utilize the rightmost k-LSB of pixels in an image to embed MP3 sound bits into a pixel. The pixels are so chosen that the distortion in image would be minimized due to embedding. This requires comparing all the possible permutations of pixel values, which may would lead to exponential time computation. To speed up this, Cuckoo Search (CS) could be used to find the most optimal solution. The advantage of using proposed CS is that it is easy to implement and is very effective at converging in relatively less iterations/generations.
