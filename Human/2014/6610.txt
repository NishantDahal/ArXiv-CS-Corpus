When relevance is not Enough: Promoting Visual Attractiveness for Fashion E-commerce

Fashion, and especially apparel, is the fastest-growing category in online shopping. As consumers requires sensory experience especially for apparel goods for which their appearance matters most, images play a key role not only in conveying crucial information that is hard to express in text, but also in affecting consumer's attitude and emotion towards the product. However, research related to e-commerce product image has mostly focused on quality at perceptual level, but not the quality of content, and the way of presenting. This study aims to address the effectiveness of types of image in showcasing fashion apparel in terms of its attractiveness, i.e. the ability to draw consumer's attention, interest, and in return their engagement. We apply advanced vision technique to quantize attractiveness using three common display types in fashion filed, i.e. human model, mannequin, and flat. We perform two-stage study by starting with large scale behavior data from real online market, then moving to well designed user experiment to further deepen our understandings on consumer's reasoning logic behind the action. We propose a Fisher noncentral hypergeometric distribution based user choice model to quantitatively evaluate user's preference. Further, we investigate the potentials to leverage visual impact for a better search that caters to user's preference. A visual attractiveness based re-ranking model that incorporates both presentation efficacy and user preference is proposed. We show quantitative improvement by promoting visual attractiveness into search on top of relevance.
