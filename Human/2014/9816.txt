Towards a Precise Semantics for Object-Oriented Modeling Techniques

In this paper we present a possible way how a precise semantics of object oriented modeling techniques can be achieved and what the possible benefits are .We outline the main modeling techniques used in the SysLab project sketch how a precise semantics can be given and how this semantics can be used during the development process.
