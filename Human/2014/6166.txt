Boolean Algebraic Programs as a Methodology for Symbolically Demonstrating Lower and Upper Bounds of Algorithms and Determinism

The lower and upper bound of any given algorithm is one of the most crucial pieces of information needed when evaluating the computational effectiveness for said algorithm. Here a novel method of Boolean Algebraic Programming for symbolic manipulation of Machines, Functions, and Inputs is presented which allows for direct analysis of time complexities and proof of deterministic methodologies. It is demonstrated through the analysis of a particular problem which is proven and solved through the application of Boolean algebraic programming.
