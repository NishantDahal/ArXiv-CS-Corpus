Text Mining System for Non-Expert Miners

Service oriented architecture integrated with text mining allows services to extract information in a well defined manner. In this paper, it is proposed to design a knowledge extracting system for the Ocean Information Data System. Deployed ARGO floating sensors of INCOIS (Indian National Council for Ocean Information Systems) organization reflects the characteristics of ocean. This is forwarded to the OIDS (Ocean Information Data System). For the data received from OIDS, pre-processing techniques are applied. Pre-processing involves the header retrieval and data separation. Header information is used to identify the region of sensor, whereas data is used in the analysis process of Ocean Information System. Analyzed data is segmented based on the region, by the header value. Mining technique and composition principle is applied on the segments for further analysis.
