Intégration des règles actives dans des documents

The management of technical documentation is an unavoidable activity interesting for the enterprises. Indeed, the need to manage documents during all the life cycle is an important issue. For that, the need to enhance the ability of document management systems is an interesting challenge. Despite existing systems on market (electronic document management systems), they are considered as non-flexible systems which are based on data models preventing any extension or improvement. In addition, those systems do not allow a slight description of documents elements and propose an insufficient mechanisms for both links and consistency management. LIRIS laboratory has developed research in this area and proposed an active system, termed SAGED, whose objectives is to manage link and consistency using active rules. However SAGED is based on an approach that split rules (for consistency management) and documents description. The main drawback is the rigidity of such approach which is highlighted whenever documents are moved from one server to another or during exchanges of documents. To contribute to solve this problem, we propose to develop an approach aiming at improve the document management including consistency. This approach is based on the introduction of rules with the XML description of the documents [BoCP01]. In this context we proposed a XML-oriented storage level allowing the storing of documents and rules uniformly through a native XML database. We defined an intelligent system termed SIGED according a client/server architecture built around an intelligent component for active rules execution. These rules are extracted from XML document, compiled and executed.
