Evaluating Dynamic Linking through the Query Process using the Licas Test Platform

A novel linking mechanism has been described previously [4] that can be used to autonomously link sources that provide related answers to queries executed over an information network. The test query platform has now been re-written resulting in essentially a new test platform using the same basic query mechanism, but with a slightly different algorithm. This paper describes recent test results on the same query test process that supports the original findings and also shows the effectiveness of the linking mechanism in a new set of test scenarios.
