An implementation on detection of trusted service provider in mobile ad-hoc networks

The mobile ad-hoc network consists of energy constraint devices called nodes communicating through radio signals forming a temporary network i.e. nodes are continuously switching from one network to another. To minimize the power consumption, we form the clusters with an elected cluster head (Service Provider) based on any cluster head selection strategy.To establish a trusted link amongst newly entered node and CH we have adopted an indirect trust computation technique based on recommendations, which form an important component in trust-based access control models for pervasive environment.In this paper, we shall present some existing indirect trust based techniques and subsequently discuss our proposal along with its merits and future scope.
