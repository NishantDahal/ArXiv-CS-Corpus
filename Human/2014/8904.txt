Challenges and Issues in Adapting Web Contents on Small Screen Devices

In general, Web pages are intended for large screen devices using HTML technology. Admittance of such Web pages on Small Screen Devices (SSDs) like mobile phones, palmtops, tablets, PDA etc., is increasing with the support of the current wireless technologies. However, SSDs have limited screen size, memory capacity and bandwidth, which makes accessing the Website on SSDs extremely difficult. There are many approaches have been proposed in literature to regenerate HTML Web pages suitable for browsing on SSDs. These proposed methods involve segment the Web page based on its semantic structure, followed by noise removal based on block features and to utilize the hierarchy of the content element to regenerate a page suitable for Small Screen Devices. But World Wide Web consortium stated that, HTML does not provide a better description of semantic structure of the web page contents. To overcome this draw backs, Web developers started to develop Web pages using new technologies like XML, Flash etc. It makes a way for new research methods. Therefore, we require an approach to reconstruct these Web pages suitable for SSDs. However, existing approaches in literature do not perform well for Web pages erected using XML and Flash. In this paper, we have emphasized a few issues of the existing approaches on XML, Flash Datasets and propose an approach that performs better on data set comprising of Flash Web pages.
