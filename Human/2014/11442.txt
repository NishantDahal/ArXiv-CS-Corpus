Area Versus Speed Trade-off Analysis of a WiMAX Deinterleaver Circuit Design

Trade-off is one of the main design parameters in the field of electronic circuit design. Whereas smaller electronics devices which use less hardware due to techniques like hardware multiplexing or due to smaller devices created due to techniques developed by nanotechnology and MEMS, are more appealing, a trade-off between area, power and speed is inevitable. This paper analyses the trade-off in the design of WiMAX deinterleaver. The main aim is to reduce the hardware utilization in a deinterleaver but speed and power consumption are important parameters which cannot be overlooked.
