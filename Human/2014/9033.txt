LT Code Design for Inactivation Decoding

We present a simple model of inactivation decoding for LT codes which can be used to estimate the decoding complexity as a function of the LT code degree distribution. The model is shown to be accurate in variety of settings of practical importance. The proposed method allows to perform a numerical optimization on the degree distribution of a LT code aiming at minimizing the number of inactivations required for decoding.
