Permutation trinomials over finite fields with even characteristic

Permutation polynomials have been a subject of study for a long time and have applications in many areas of science and engineering. However, only a small number of specific classes of permutation polynomials are described in the literature so far. In this paper we present a number of permutation trinomials over finite fields, which are of different forms.
