Coordinate Descent with Online Adaptation of Coordinate Frequencies

Coordinate descent (CD) algorithms have become the method of choice for solving a number of optimization problems in machine learning. They are particularly popular for training linear models, including linear support vector machine classification, LASSO regression, and logistic regression.
  We consider general CD with non-uniform selection of coordinates. Instead of fixing selection frequencies beforehand we propose an online adaptation mechanism for this important parameter, called the adaptive coordinate frequencies (ACF) method. This mechanism removes the need to estimate optimal coordinate frequencies beforehand, and it automatically reacts to changing requirements during an optimization run.
  We demonstrate the usefulness of our ACF-CD approach for a variety of optimization problems arising in machine learning contexts. Our algorithm offers significant speed-ups over state-of-the-art training methods.
