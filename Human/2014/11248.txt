Identification Codes to Identify Multiple Objects

In the case of ordinary identification coding, a code is devised to identify a single object among $N$ objects. But, in this paper, we consider an identification coding problem to identify $K$ objects at once among $N$ objects in the both cases that $K$ objects are ranked or not ranked. By combining Kurosawa-Yoshida scheme with Moulin-Koetter scheme, an efficient identification coding scheme is proposed, which can attain high coding rate and error exponents compared with the case that an ordinary identification code is used $K$ times. Furthermore, the achievable triplet of rate and error exponents of type I and type II decoding error probabilities are derived for the proposed coding scheme.
