The Sum-Product Algorithm for Degree-2 Check Nodes and Trapping Sets

The sum-product algorithm for decoding of binary codes is analyzed for bipartite graphs in which the check nodes all have degree $2$. The algorithm simplifies dramatically and may be expressed using linear algebra. Exact results about the convergence of the algorithm are derived and applied to trapping sets.
