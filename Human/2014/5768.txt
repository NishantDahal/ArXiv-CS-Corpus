Contextual Semantic Parsing using Crowdsourced Spatial Descriptions

We describe a contextual parser for the Robot Commands Treebank, a new crowdsourced resource. In contrast to previous semantic parsers that select the most-probable parse, we consider the different problem of parsing using additional situational context to disambiguate between different readings of a sentence. We show that multiple semantic analyses can be searched using dynamic programming via interaction with a spatial planner, to guide the parsing process. We are able to parse sentences in near linear-time by ruling out analyses early on that are incompatible with spatial context. We report a 34% upper bound on accuracy, as our planner correctly processes spatial context for 3,394 out of 10,000 sentences. However, our parser achieves a 96.53% exact-match score for parsing within the subset of sentences recognized by the planner, compared to 82.14% for a non-contextual parser.
