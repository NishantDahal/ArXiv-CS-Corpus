Proceedings 7th Interaction and Concurrency Experience

This volume contains the proceedings of ICE 2014, the 7th Interaction and Concurrency Experience, which was held in Berlin, Germany on the 6th of June 2014 as a satellite event of DisCoTec 2014. The ICE procedure for paper selection allows PC members to interact, anonymously, with authors. During the review phase, each submitted paper is published on a Wiki and associated with a discussion forum whose access is restricted to the authors and to all the PC members not declaring a conflict of interests. The PC members post comments and questions that the authors reply to. Each paper was reviewed by three PC members, and altogether 8 papers (including 3 short papers) were accepted for publication. We were proud to host two invited talks, by Pavol Cerny and Kim Larsen, whose abstracts are included in this volume together with the regular papers.
