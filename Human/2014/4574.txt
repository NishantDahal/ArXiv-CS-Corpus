In this paper we examine how culture influences the popularity of marketing messages in social media platforms. Text mining, automated translation and sentiment analysis contribute largely to our research. From our analysis of 400 posts on the localized Google+ pages of German car brands in Germany and the US, we conclude that posting time and emotions are important predictors for reshare counts.
