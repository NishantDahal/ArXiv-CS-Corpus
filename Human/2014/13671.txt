Color Image Enhancement In the Framework of Logarithmic Models

In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for color image processing. It is a logarithmical one. We consider the cube (-1,1)x(-1,1)x(-1,1) as the set of values for the color space. We define two operations: addition <+> and real scalar multiplication <x>. With these operations the space of colors becomes a real vector space. Then, defining the scalar product (.|.) and the norm || . ||, we obtain a (logarithmic) Euclidean space. We show how we can use this model for color image enhancement and we present some experimental results.
