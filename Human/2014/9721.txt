Combinatorial presentation of multidimensional persistent homology

A multifiltration is a functor indexed by $\mathbb{N}^r$ that maps any morphism to a monomorphism. The goal of this paper is to describe in an explicit and combinatorial way the natural $\mathbb{N}^r$-graded $R[x_1,\ldots, x_r]$-module structure on the homology of a multifiltration of simplicial complexes. To do that we study multifiltrations of sets and vector spaces. We prove in particular that the $\mathbb{N}^r$-graded $R[x_1,\ldots, x_r]$-modules that can occur as $R$-spans of multifiltrations of sets are the direct sums of monomial ideals.
