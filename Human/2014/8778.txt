High-Level Design of Portable and Scalable FPGA Accelerators

This paper presents our approach for making FPGA accelerators accessible to software (SW) programmers. It is intended as a starting point for collaborations with other groups pursuing similar objectives. We report on our current SAccO platform (Scalable Accelerator platform Osnabr√ºck) and the planned project extending this platform.
