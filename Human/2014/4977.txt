Multidimensional Manifold Extraction for Multicarrier Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution

We introduce the multidimensional manifold extraction for multicarrier continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD). The manifold extraction utilizes the resources that are injected into the transmission by the additional degrees of freedom of the multicarrier modulation. We demonstrate the results through the AMQD (adaptive multicarrier quadrature division) scheme, which granulates the information into Gaussian subcarrier CVs and divides the physical link into several Gaussian sub-channels for the transmission. We prove that the exploitable extra degree of freedom in a multicarrier CVQKD scenario significantly extends the possibilities of single-carrier CVQKD. The manifold extraction allows for the parties to reach decreased error probabilities by utilizing those extra resources of a multicarrier transmission that are not available in a single-carrier CVQKD setting. We define the multidimensional manifold space of multicarrier CVQKD and the optimal tradeoff between the available degrees of freedom of the multicarrier transmission. We also extend the manifold extraction for the multiple-access AMQD-MQA (multiuser quadrature allocation) multicarrier protocol. The additional resources of multicarrier CVQKD allow the achievement of significant performance improvements that are particularly crucial in an experimental scenario.
