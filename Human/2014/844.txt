Computer model of teaching with the varied coefficient of forgetting

At computer modeling of process of training it is usually supposed that all elements of a training material are forgotten with an identical speed. But in practice that knowledge which are included in educational activity of the pupil are remembered much more strongly and forgotten more slowly then knowledge which he doesn't use. For the purpose of more exact research of didactic systems is offered the model of training, in which consider that in case increasing the number of applications of this element of a learning material: 1) duration of its use by the pupil decreases; 2) the coefficient of forgetting decreases. The computer model is considered, programs in the Pascal language are submitted, results of modeling are given and analyzed. Keywords: didactics, information and cybernetic approach, computer modeling of process of training.
