Quantum annealing

Brief description on the state of the art of some local optimization methods: Quantum annealing Quantum annealing (also known as alloy, crystallization or tempering) is analogous to simulated annealing but in substitution of thermal activation by quantum tunneling. The class of algorithmic methods for quantum annealing (dubbed: 'QA'), sometimes referred by the italian school as Quantum Stochastic Optimization ('QSO'), is a promising metaheuristic tool for solving local search problems in multivariable optimization contexts.
