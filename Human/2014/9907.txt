Compositional inverses, complete mappings, orthogonal Latin squares and bent functions

We study compositional inverses of permutation polynomials, complete mappings, mutually orthogonal Latin squares, and bent vectorial functions. Recently it was obtained in [33] the compositional inverses of linearized permutation binomials over finite fields. It was also noted in [29] that computing inverses of bijections of subspaces have applications in determining the compositional inverses of certain permutation classes related to linearized polynomials. In this paper we obtain compositional inverses of a class of linearized binomials permuting the kernel of the trace map. As an application of this result, we give the compositional inverse of a class of complete mappings. This complete mapping class improves upon a recent construction given in [34]. We also construct recursively a class of complete mappings involving multi-trace functions. Finally we use these complete mappings to derive a set of mutually orthogonal Latin squares, and to construct a class of $p$-ary bent vectorial functions from the Maiorana-McFarland class.
