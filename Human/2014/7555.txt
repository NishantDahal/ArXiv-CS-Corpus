The package HarmonicSums: Computer Algebra and Analytic aspects of Nested Sums

This paper summarizes the essential functionality of the computer algebra package HarmonicSums. On the one hand HarmonicSums can work with nested sums such as harmonic sums and their generalizations and on the other hand it can treat iterated integrals of the Poincare and Chen-type, such as harmonic polylogarithms and their generalizations. The interplay of these representations and the analytic aspects are illustrated by concrete examples.
