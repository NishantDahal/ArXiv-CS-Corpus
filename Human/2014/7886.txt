A Proposed Infrastructure for Adding Online Interaction to Any Evolutionary Domain

To address the difficulty of creating online collaborative evolutionary systems, this paper presents a new prototype library called Worldwide Infrastructure for Neuroevolution (WIN) and its accompanying site WIN Online (http://winark.org/). The WIN library is a collection of software packages built on top of Node.js that reduce the complexity of creating fully persistent, online, and interactive (or automated) evolutionary platforms around any domain. WIN Online is the public interface for WIN, providing an online collection of domains built with the WIN library that lets novice and expert users browse and meaningfully contribute to ongoing experiments. The long term goal of WIN is to make it trivial to connect any platform to the world, providing both a stream of online users, and archives of data and discoveries for later extension by humans or computers.
