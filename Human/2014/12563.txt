Proceedings First Workshop on Logics and Model-checking for Self-* Systems

This volume contains the proceedings of the First Workshop on Logics and Model-checking for self-* systems (MOD* 2014). The worshop took place in Bertinoro, Italy, on 12th of September 2014, and was a satellite event of iFM 2014 (the 11th International Conference on Integrated Formal Methods). The workshop focuses on demonstrating the applicability of Formal Methods on modern complex systems with a high degree of self-adaptivity and reconfigurability, by bringing together researchers and practitioners with the goal of pushing forward the state of the art on logics and model checking.
