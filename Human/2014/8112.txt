CBM-Of-TRaCE: An Ontology-Driven Framework for the Improvement of Business Service Traceability, Consistency Management and Reusability

In this paper, we represent CBM-Of-TRaCE which is an ontological framework that integrates two aspects of business components: conceptual and methodology. In the development of our framework we have taken IBM Actionable Business Approach (ABA) in to consideration. We evaluate our framework through some aspects such as support and facilitation for a business from five different aspects: service-orientation, business process, management integration, reusability improvement, consistency rules, and traceability. As well, we demonstrate the compatibility of our CBM-Of-TRaCE with ABA four phases.
