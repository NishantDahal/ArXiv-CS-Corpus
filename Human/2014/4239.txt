Analysis of Computer Hardware Affecting Video Transmission via IEEE 1394a connection

When 60 de-interlaced fields per second digital uncompressed video is streamed to a computer, some video fields are lost and not able to be stored on a computer s hard drive successfully. Additionally, this problem amplifies once multiple video sources are deployed. If it is possible to stream digital uncompressed video without dropped video fields, then a sophisticated computer analysis of the transmitted via IEEE 1394a connection video is possible. Such process is used in biomechanics when it is important to analyze athletes performance via streaming digital uncompressed video to a computer and then analyzing it. If a loss of video fields occurs, then a quality analysis of video is not possible.
