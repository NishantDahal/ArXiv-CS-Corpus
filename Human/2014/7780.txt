A Generalized Write Channel Model for Bit-Patterned Media Recording

In this paper, we propose a generalized write channel model for bit-patterned media recording by considering all sources of errors causing some extra disturbances during write process, in addition to data dependent write synchronization errors. We investigate information-theoretic bounds for this new model according to various input distributions and also compare it numerically to the last proposed model.
