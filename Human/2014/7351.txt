Integrated ERP System for Improving the Functional efficiency of the organization by Customized Architecture

An ERP is a kind of package which consist front end and backend as DBMS like a collection of DBMSs. You can create DBMS to manage one aspect of your business. For example, a publishing house has a database of books that keeps information about books such as Author Name, Title, Translator Name, etc. But this database app only helps enter books data and search them. It doesn't help them, for example, sell books. They get or develop another DBMS database that has all the Books data plus prices, discount formulas, names of common clients, etc. Now they connect the Books database to Sales database and maybe also the inventory database. Now its DBMS slowly turning into an ERP. They may add payroll database and connect it to this ERP. They may develop sales staff and commissions database and connect it to this ERP and so on. In the traditional Database management system the different databases are used for the various Campuses of the JSPM Group of Education like Wagholi Campus, Tathwade Campus, Narhe Campus, Hadpsar Campuses, Bhavdhan Campus as well as Corporate office at Katraj of same organization so it is not possible to keep different databases for the same so in this paper proposed the use of Integrated Database for the Entire organization using ERP system. The Proposed ERP system applied on the existing Architecture of the JSPM Group; the marginal difference observed in the Databases need to be accessed to generate the same number of Reports when use the Traditional DBMS which end up with improvement in the Functional efficiency of Organizational Architecture.
