A Linear Category of Polynomial Functors (extensional part)

We construct a symmetric monoidal closed category of polynomial endofunctors (as objects) and simulation cells (as morphisms). This structure is defined using universal properties without reference to representing polynomial diagrams and is reminiscent of Day's convolution on presheaves. We then make this category into a model for intuitionistic linear logic by defining an additive and exponential structure.
