Extra Gain:Improved Sparse Channel Estimation Using Reweighted l_1-norm Penalized LMS/F Algorithm

The channel estimation is one of important techniques to ensure reliable broadband signal transmission. Broadband channels are often modeled as a sparse channel. Comparing with traditional dense-assumption based linear channel estimation methods, e.g., least mean square/fourth (LMS/F) algorithm, exploiting sparse structure information can get extra performance gain. By introducing l_1-norm penalty, two sparse LMS/F algorithms, (zero-attracting LMSF, ZA-LMS/F and reweighted ZA-LMSF, RZA-LMSF), have been proposed [1]. Motivated by existing reweighted l_1-norm (RL1) sparse algorithm in compressive sensing [2], we propose an improved channel estimation method using RL1 sparse penalized LMS/F (RL1-LMS/F) algorithm to exploit more efficient sparse structure information. First, updating equation of RL1-LMS/F is derived. Second, we compare their sparse penalize strength via figure example. Finally, computer simulation results are given to validate the superiority of proposed method over than conventional two methods.
