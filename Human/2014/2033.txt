New Outer Bounds for the Interference Channel with Unilateral Source Cooperation

This paper studies the two-user interference channel with unilateral source cooperation, which consists of two source-destination pairs that share the same channel and where one full-duplex source can overhear the other source through a noisy in-band link. Novel outer bounds of the type 2Rp+Rc/Rp+2Rc are developed for the class of injective semi-deterministic channels with independent noises at the different source-destination pairs. The bounds are then specialized to the Gaussian noise case. Interesting insights are provided about when these types of bounds are active, or in other words, when unilateral cooperation is too weak and leaves "holes" in the system resources.
