A Decision Matrix and Monitoring based Framework for Infrastructure Performance Enhancement in A Cloud based Environment

Cloud environment is very different from traditional computing environment and therefore tracking the performance of cloud leverages additional requirements. The movement of data in cloud is very fast. Hence, it requires that resources and infrastructure available at disposal must be equally competent. Infrastructure level performance in cloud involves the performance of servers, network and storage which act as the heart and soul for driving the entire cloud business. Thus a constant improvement and enhancement of infrastructure level performance is an important task that needs to be taken into account. This paper proposes a framework for infrastructure performance enhancement in a cloud based environment. The framework is broadly divided into four steps: a) Infrastructure level monitoring of usage pattern and behaviour of the cloud end users, b) Reporting of the monitoring activities to the cloud service provider c) Cloud service provider assigns priority according to our decision matrix based max-min algorithm (DMMM) d) Providing services to cloud users leading to infrastructure performance enhancement. Our framework is based on decision matrix and monitoring in cloud using our proposed decision matrix based max-min algorithm, which draws its inspiration from the original min-min algorithm. This algorithm makes use of decision matrix to make decisions regarding distribution of resources among the cloud users.
