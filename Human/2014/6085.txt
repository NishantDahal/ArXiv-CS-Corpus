Fast Computation of the Series Impedance of Power Cables with Inclusion of Skin and Proximity Effects

We present an efficient numerical technique for calculating the series impedance matrix of systems with round conductors. The method is based on a surface admittance operator in combination with the method of moments and it accurately predicts both skin and proximity effects. Application to a three-phase armored cable with wire screens demonstrates a speed-up by a factor of about 100 compared to a finite elements computation. The inclusion of proximity effect in combination with the high efficiency makes the new method very attractive for cable modeling within EMTP-type simulation tools. Currently, these tools can only take skin effect into account.
