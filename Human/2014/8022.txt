Lexpresso: a Controlled Natural Language

This paper presents an overview of `Lexpresso', a Controlled Natural Language developed at the Defence Science & Technology Organisation as a bidirectional natural language interface to a high-level information fusion system. The paper describes Lexpresso's main features including lexical coverage, expressiveness and range of linguistic syntactic and semantic structures. It also touches on its tight integration with a formal semantic formalism and tentatively classifies it against the PENS system.
