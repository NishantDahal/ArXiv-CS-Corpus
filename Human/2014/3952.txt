A new combination approach based on improved evidence distance

Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is a powerful tool in information fusion. When the evidence are highly conflicting, the counter-intuitive results will be presented. To adress this open issue, a new method based on evidence distance of Jousselme and Hausdorff distance is proposed. Weight of each evidence can be computed, preprocess the original evidence to generate a new evidence. The Dempster's combination rule is used to combine the new evidence. Comparing with the existing methods, the new proposed method is efficient.
