Human Face as human single identity

Human face as a physical human recognition can be used as a unique identity for computer to recognize human by transforming human face with face algorithm as simple text number which can be primary key for human. Human face as single identity for human will be done by making a huge and large world centre human face database, where the human face around the world will be recorded from time to time and from generation to generation. Architecture database will be divided become human face image database which will save human face images and human face output code which will save human face output code as a transformation human face image with face algorithm. As an improvement the slightly and simple human face output code database will make human face searching process become more fast. Transaction with human face as a transaction without card can make human no need their card for the transaction and office automation and banking system as an example for implementation architecture. As an addition suspect human face database can be extended for fighting crime and terrorism by doing surveillance and searching suspect human face around the world.
