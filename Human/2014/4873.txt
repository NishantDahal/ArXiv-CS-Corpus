A New Web Based Student Annual Review Information System (SARIS) With Student Success Prediction

In this paper, we are proposing new web based Student Annual Review Information System (SARIS) and prediction method for the success of scholar students to China Scholarship Council(CSC). The main objective of developing this system is to save the cost of paper, to reduce the risk of data loss, to decrease the processing time, to reduce the delay in finding for the successful students. The proposed system and prediction method is intended to be used by China Scholarship Council; however SARIS and prediction method are quite generic and can be used by other scholarship agencies.
