Mobile Agent Systems, Recent Security Threats and Counter Measures

Mobile agent technology offers a dramatically evolving computing paradigm in which a program, in the form of a software agent, can suspend its execution on a host computer, transfers itself to another agent-enabled host on the network, and resumes execution on the new host. It is 1960's since mobile code has been used in the form of remote job entry systems. Today's mobile agents can be characterized in a number of ways ranging from simple distributed objects to highly organized intelligent softwares. As a result of this rapid evolvement of mobile agents, plenty of critical security issues has risen and plenty of work is being done to address these problems. The aim is to provide trusted mobile agent systems that can be easily deployed and widely adopted. In this paper, we provide an overview of the most recent threats facing the designers of agent platforms and the developers of agent-based applications. The paper also identifies security objectives, and measures for countering the identified threats and fulfilling those security objectives.
