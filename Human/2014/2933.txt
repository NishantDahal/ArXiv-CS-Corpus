Using Cluster Curves to Control Software Development Projects

Online interpretation and visualization of project data are gaining increasing importance on the long road towards predictable and controllable software project execution. This paper sketches the Sprint I controlling approach for software development projects and gives first evaluation results. The approach is grounded on the usage of context-oriented cluster curves and integrated in the framework of software project control centers.
