Through Global Monitoring to School of the Future: Smartphone as a Laboratory in Pocket of Each Student

The idea to unite smartphones used as personal environmental sensors and health indicators into a scalable network for data collection and processing by the internet-cloud is proposed. Access to the sensors, which are available in every smartphone, will provide the appropriate software. Such a monitoring at the global level would reveal the impact of the electromagnetic radiation, environmental pollution and weather factors on human health. Participation of students in these measurements increases their educational and social activities.
