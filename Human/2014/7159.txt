Análisis e implementación de algoritmos evolutivos para la optimización de simulaciones en ingeniería civil. (draft)

This paper studies the applicability of evolutionary algorithms, particularly, the evolution strategies family in order to estimate a degradation parameter in the shear design of reinforced concrete members. This problem represents a great computational task and is highly relevant in the framework of the structural engineering that for the first time is solved using genetic algorithms.
