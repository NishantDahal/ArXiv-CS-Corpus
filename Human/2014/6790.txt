Extended Differential Aggregations in Process Algebra for Performance and Biology

We study aggregations for ordinary differential equations induced by fluid semantics for Markovian process algebra which can capture the dynamics of performance models and chemical reaction networks. Whilst previous work has required perfect symmetry for exact aggregation, we present approximate fluid lumpability, which makes nearby processes perfectly symmetric after a perturbation of their parameters. We prove that small perturbations yield nearby differential trajectories. Numerically, we show that many heterogeneous processes can be aggregated with negligible errors.
