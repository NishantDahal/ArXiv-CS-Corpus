An Approach for Normalizing Fuzzy Relational Databases Based on Join Dependency

Fuzziness in databases is used to denote uncertain or incomplete data. Relational Databases stress on the nature of the data to be certain. This certainty based data is used as the basis of the normalization approach designed for traditional relational databases. But real world data may not always be certain, thereby making it necessary to design an approach for normalization that deals with fuzzy data. This paper focuses on the approach for designing the fifth normal form (5NF) based on join dependencies for fuzzy data. The basis of join dependency for fuzzy relational databases is derived from the basic relational database concepts. As join dependency implies an multivalued dependency by symmetry the proof of join dependency based normalization is stated from the perspective of multivalued dependency based normalization on fuzzy relational databases.
