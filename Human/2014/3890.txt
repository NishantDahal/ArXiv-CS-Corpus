Cooperating distributed context-free hexagonal array grammar systems with permitting contexts

In this paper we associate permitting symbols with rules of Grammars in the components of cooperating distributed context free hexagonal array grammar systems as a control mechanism and investigating the generative power of the resulting systems in the terminal mode. This feature of associating permitting symbols with rules when extended to patterns in the form of connected arrays also requires checking of symbols, but this is simpler than usual pattern matching. The benefit of allowing permitting symbols is that it enables us to reduce the number of components required in a cooperating distributed hexagonal array grammar system for generating a set of picture arrays.
