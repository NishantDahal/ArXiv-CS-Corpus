Possibilities of technologization of philosophical knowledge

Article purpose is the analysis of a question of possibility of technologization of philosophical knowledge. We understand the organization of cognitive activity which is guided by the set of methods guaranteed bringing to successful (i.e. to precisely corresponding set parameters) to applied results as technologization. Transformation of sense of philosophy allows revealing possibilities of its technologization. The leading role in this process is played by philosophy of science which creates conditions for such transformation. At the same time there is justified an appeal to branch combination theory of the directions of scientific knowledge and partial refusal of understanding of philosophy as synthetic knowledge in which the main task is permission, instead of generation of paradoxes.
