Formale Entwicklung einer Steuerung f√ºr eine Fertigungszelle mit SYSYFOS

Using the synthesis approach of Manna and Waldinger, a formally specified and verified control circuitery for a production cell was developped. Building an appropriate formal language level, we could achieve a requirements specification to the informal description. We demonstrated that the paradigm of deductive synthesis can be applied to the development of complete verified systems, including hardware and mechanics. We defined two domain-specific logical operators that schematise frequent patterns in specification and proof and hence allow a more concise and expressive presentation. In Burghardt (1995), an english short version of this paper, without appendices, can be found.
