Grace: a Cross-platform Micromagnetic Simulator On Graphics Processing Units

A micromagnetic simulator running on graphics processing unit (GPU) is presented. It achieves significant performance boost as compared to previous central processing unit (CPU) simulators, up to two orders of magnitude for large input problems. Different from GPU implementations of other research groups, this simulator is developed with C++ Accelerated Massive Parallelism (C++ AMP) and is hardware platform compatible. It runs on GPU from venders include NVidia, AMD and Intel, which paved the way for fast micromagnetic simulation on both high-end workstations with dedicated graphics cards and low-end personal computers with integrated graphics card. A copy of the simulator software is publicly available.
