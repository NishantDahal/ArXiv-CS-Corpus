Replacing ANSI C with other modern programming languages

Replacing ANSI C language with other modern programming languages such as Python or Java may be an actual debate topic in technical universities. Researchers whose primary interests are not in programming area seem to prefer modern and higher level languages. Keeping standard language ANSI C as a primary tool for engineers and for microcontrollers programming, robotics and data acquisition courses is another strong different opinion trend. Function oriented versus object oriented languages may be another highlighted topic in actual debates.
