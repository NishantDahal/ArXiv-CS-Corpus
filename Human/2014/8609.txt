Mathematical Knowledge Representation: Semantic Models and Formalisms

The paper provides a survey of semantic methods for solution of fundamental tasks in mathematical knowledge management. Ontological models and formalisms are discussed. We propose an ontology of mathematical knowledge, covering a wide range of fields of mathematics. We demonstrate applications of this representation in mathematical formula search, and learning.
