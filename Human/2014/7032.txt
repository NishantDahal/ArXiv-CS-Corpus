Revised Version of a JCIT Paper-Comparison of Feature Point Extraction Algorithms for Vision Based Autonomous Aerial Refueling

This is a revised version of our paper published in Journal of Convergence Information Technology(JCIT): "Comparison of Feature Point Extraction Algorithms for Vision Based Autonomous Aerial Refueling". We corrected some errors including measurement unit errors, spelling errors and so on. Since the published papers in JCIT are not allowed to be modified, we submit the revised version to arXiv.org to make the paper more rigorous and not to confuse other researchers.
