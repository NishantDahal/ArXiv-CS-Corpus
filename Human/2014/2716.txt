Classroom Video Assessment and Retrieval via Multiple Instance Learning

We propose a multiple instance learning approach to content-based retrieval of classroom video for the purpose of supporting human assessing the learning environment. The key element of our approach is a mapping between the semantic concepts of the assessment system and features of the video that can be measured using techniques from the fields of computer vision and speech analysis. We report on a formative experiment in content-based video retrieval involving trained experts in the Classroom Assessment Scoring System, a widely used framework for assessment and improvement of learning environments. The results of this experiment suggest that our approach has potential application to productivity enhancement in assessment and to broader retrieval tasks.
