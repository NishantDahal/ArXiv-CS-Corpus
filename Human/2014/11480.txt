Novel energy detection using uniform noise distribution

Energy detection is widely used in cognitive radio due to its low complexity. One fundamental challenge is that its performance degrades in the presence of noise uncertainty, which inevitably occurs in practical implementations. In this work, three novel detectors based on uniformly distributed noise uncertainty as the worst-case scenario are proposed. Numerical results show that the new detectors outperform the conventional energy detector with considerable performance gains.
