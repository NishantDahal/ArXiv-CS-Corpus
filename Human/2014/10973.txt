Performance evaluation with a Comparative analysis of mimo channel on The basis of doppler shift and other Probabilistic parameters in fading Environment

At this present scenario, the demand of the system capacity is very high in wireless network. MIMO technology is used from the last decade to provide this requirement for wireless network antenna technology. MIMO channels are mostly used for advanced antenna array technology. But it is most important to control the error rate with enhanced system capacity in MIMO for present-day progressive wireless communication. This paper explores the frame error rate with respect to different path gain of MIMO channel. This work has been done in different fading scenario and produces a comparative analysis of MIMO on the basis of those fading models in various conditions. Here, it is to be considered that modulation technique as QPSK to observe these comparative evaluations for different Doppler frequencies. From the comparative analysis, minimum amount of frame error rate is viewed for Rician distribution at LOS path Doppler shift of 0 Hz. At last, this work is concluded with a comparative bit error rate study on the basis of singular parameters at different SNR levels to produce the system performance for uncoded QPSK modulation.
