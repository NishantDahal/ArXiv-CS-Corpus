A Preliminary Survey of Knowledge Discovery on Smartphone Applications (apps): Principles, Techniques and Research Directions for E-health

People usually seek out varied information to deal with their health problems. However, the large volume of information available may present challenges for the public to distinguish good from suboptimal advice. How to ensure the right information for the right person at the right time and place has always been a challenge. For example, smart phone application vendor markets provide a varied selection of health applications for users. However, there is a lack of substantive reference information for consumers to base well-informed decisions about whether or not to adopt the applications they review and to ascertain the validity of the information provided by these e-health solutions. Thus, this study aims to review the existing relevant research about smart phone applications and identify pertinent research questions in the field of knowledge discovery for health applications that can be addressed in future research. Therefore, this study can be seen as an important step for researchers to explore this domain and extend our work for the well-being of public.
