Design and Implementation of Hierarchical Visual cryptography with Expansion less Shares

Novel idea of hierarchical visual cryptography is stated in this paper. The key concept of hierarchical visual cryptography is based upon visual cryptography. Visual cryptography encrypts secret information into two pieces called as shares. These two shares are stacked together by logical XOR operation to reveal the original secret. Hierarchical visual cryptography encrypts the secret in various levels. The encryption in turn is expansionless. The original secret size is retained in the shares at all levels. In this paper secret is encrypted at two different levels. Four shares are generated out of hierarchical visual cryptography. Any three shares are collectively taken to form the key share. All shares generated are meaningless giving no information by visual inspection. Performance analysis is also obtained based upon various categories of secrets. The greying effect is completely removed while revealing the secret Removal of greying effect do not change the meaning of secret.
