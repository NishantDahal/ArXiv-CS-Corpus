Combinatorial Nullstellensatz modulo prime powers and the Parity Argument

We present new generalizations of Olson's theorem and of a consequence of Alon's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. These enable us to extend some of their combinatorial applications with conditions modulo primes to conditions modulo prime powers. We analyze computational search problems corresponding to these kinds of combinatorial questions and we prove that the problem of finding degree-constrained subgraphs modulo $2^d$ such as $2^d$-divisible subgraphs and the search problem corresponding to the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz over $\mathbb{F}_2$ belong to the complexity class Polynomial Parity Argument (PPA).
