Asynchronous Transmission of Wireless Multicast System with Genetic Joint Antennas Selection

Optimal antenna selection algorithm of multicast transmission can significantly reduce the number of antennas and can acquire lower complexity and high performance which is close to that of exhaustive search. An asynchronous multicast transmission mechanism based on genetic antenna selection is proposed. The computational complexity of genetic antenna selection algorithm remains moderate while the total number of antennas increases comparing with optimum searching algorithm. Symbol error rate (SER) and capacity of our mechanism are analyzed and simulated, and the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism can achieve better SER and sub-maximum channel capacity in wireless multicast systems.
