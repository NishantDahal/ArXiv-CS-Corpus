A Cryptographic Scheme Of Mellin Transform

In this paper it has been developed an algorithm for cryptography, using the Mellin's transform. Cryptography is very important to protect data to ensure that two people, using an insecure channel, may communicate in a secure way. In the present age, ensure the communications will essential to shared data that have to be protected. The original message is a plain text, and the encrypted form as cipher text. The cipher text message contains all the information of the plain text, but is cannot be read from a human without a key and a method to decrypt it.
