Facets and Typed Relations as Tools for Reasoning Processes in Information Retrieval

Faceted arrangement of entities and typed relations for representing different associations between the entities are established tools in knowledge representation. In this paper, a proposal is being discussed combining both tools to draw inferences along relational paths. This approach may yield new benefit for information retrieval processes, especially when modeled for heterogeneous environments in the Semantic Web. Faceted arrangement can be used as a se-lection tool for the semantic knowledge modeled within the knowledge repre-sentation. Typed relations between the entities of different facets can be used as restrictions for selecting them across the facets.
