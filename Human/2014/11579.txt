Using Professional Social Networking as an Innovative Method for Data Extraction: The ICT Alumni Index Case Study

The lack of data regarding Information and Communications Technology sector alumni data is a known problem in several countries including Egypt. It is not clear what entry and senior jobs are occupied by alumni and which countries attract them. This affects the planning, design and execution of both the ICT sector and the Education sector. In this research, a joint team is formulated from the Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center TIEC and the Ministry of Higher Education. This team is undertaking extensive analysis of the structure, distribution and development of the ICT skills and employment.
