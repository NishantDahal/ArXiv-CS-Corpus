Optimization of Vehicle Dynamics based on Multibody Models using Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis

Multibody dynamics simulations have become widely used tools for vehicle systems analysis and design. As this approach evolves, it becomes able to provide additional information for various types of analyses. One very important direction is the optimization of multibody systems. Sensitivity analysis of multibody system dynamics is essential for design optimization. Dynamic sensitivities, when needed, are often calculated by means of finite differences. However, depending of the number of parameters involved, this procedure can be computationally expensive. Moreover, in many cases the results suffer from low accuracy when real perturbations are used. This paper develops the adjoint sensitivity analysis of multibody systems in the context of penalty formulations. The resulting sensitivities are applied to perform dynamical optimization of a full vehicle system.
