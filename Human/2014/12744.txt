Pervasive Healthcare-A Comprehensive Survey of Tools and Techniques

Pervasive healthcare is an emerging technology that aims to provide round-the-clock monitoring of several vital signs of patients using various health sensors, specialized communication protocols, and intelligent context-aware applications. Pervasive healthcare applications proactively contact the caregiver provided any abnormality arises in the health condition of a monitored patient. It has been a boon to the patients suffering from different diseases and requiring continuous monitoring and care, such as, disabled individuals, elderly and weak persons living alone, children of different ages, and adults who are susceptible to near-fatal falls or sudden increases in blood pressure, heart rates, stress level, etc. Existing surveys on pervasive healthcare cover generic techniques or a particular application, like fall detection. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive coverage of several common disorders addressed by pervasive healthcare in recent years. We roughly classify different diseases by age groups of patients and then discuss various hardware and software tools and techniques to detect or treat them. We have also included detailed tabular classification of a large selection of significant research articles in pervasive healthcare.
