The Short-term Memory (D.C. Response) of the Memristor Demonstrates the Causes of the Memristor Frequency Effect

A memristor is often identified by showing its distinctive pinched hysteresis curve and testing for the effect of frequency. The hysteresis size should relate to frequency and shrink to zero as the frequency approaches infinity. Although mathematically understood, the material causes for this are not well known. The d.c. response of the memristor is a decaying curve with its own timescale. We show via mathematical reasoning that this decaying curve when transformed to a.c. leads to the frequency effect by considering a descretized curve. We then demonstrate the validity of this approach with experimental data from two different types of memristors.
