Guided Support for Collaborative Modeling, Enactment and Simulation of Software Development Processes

Recently, the awareness of the importance of distributed software development has been growing in the software engineering community. Economic constraints, more and more outsourcing of development activities, and the increasing spatial distribution of companies come along with challenges of how to organize distributed development.
  In this article, we reason that a common process understanding is mandatory for successful distributed development. Integrated process planning, guidance and enactment are seen as enabling technologies to reach a unique process view.
  We sketch a synthesis of the software process modeling environment SPEARMINT and the XCHIPS system for web-based process support. Hereby, planners and developers are provided with collaborative planning and enactment support and advanced process guidance via electronic process guides (EPGs). We describe the usage of this integrated environment by using a case study for the development of a learning system.
