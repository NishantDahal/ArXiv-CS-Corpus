A Signal Processor for Gaussian Message Passing

In this paper, we present a novel signal processing unit built upon the theory of factor graphs, which is able to address a wide range of signal processing algorithms. More specifically, the demonstrated factor graph processor (FGP) is tailored to Gaussian message passing algorithms. We show how to use a highly configurable systolic array to solve the message update equations of nodes in a factor graph efficiently. A proper instruction set and compilation procedure is presented. In a recursive least squares channel estimation example we show that the FGP can compute a message update faster than a state-ofthe- art DSP. The results demonstrate the usabilty of the FGP architecture as a flexible HW accelerator for signal-processing and communication systems.
