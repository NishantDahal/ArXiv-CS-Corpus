Exploring gender differences on general and specific computer self-efficacy in mobile learning adoption

Reasons for contradictory findings regarding the gender moderate effect on computer self-efficacy in the adoption of e-learning/mobile learning are limited. Recognizing the multilevel nature of the computer self-efficacy (CSE), this study attempts to explore gender differences in the adoption of mobile learning, by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with general and specific CSE. Data collected from 137 university students were tested against the research model using the structural equation modeling approach. The results suggest that there are significant gender differences in perceptions of general CSE, perceived ease of use and behavioral intention to use but no significant differences in specific CSE, perceived usefulness. Additionally, the findings reveal that specific CSE is more salient than general CSE in influencing perceived ease of use while general CSE seems to be the salient factor on perceived usefulness for both female and male combined. Moreover, general CSE was salient to determine the behavioral intention to use indirectly for female despite lower perception of general CSE than male's, and specific CSE exhibited stronger indirect effect on behavioral intention to use than general CSE for female despite similar perception of specific CSE as males'. These findings provide important implications for mobile learning adoption and usage.
